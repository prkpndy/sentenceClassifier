The first one is currently how it will return without the populate. What i'd like is to achieve the second one with the populate.,1

"Google LLC is an American multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related services and products, which include online advertising technologies, a search engine, cloud computing, software, and hardware",0
Together they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock,0
"[13] An initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex",0
"
 
 The company's rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, acquisitions, and partnerships beyond Google's core search engine (Google Search)",0
"It offers services designed for work and productivity (Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides), email (Gmail), scheduling and time management (Google Calendar), cloud storage (Google Drive), instant messaging and video chat (Duo, Hangouts), language translation (Google Translate), mapping and navigation (Google Maps, Waze, Google Earth, Street View), video sharing (YouTube), note-taking (Google Keep), and photo organizing and editing (Google Photos)",0
"The company leads the development of the Android mobile operating system, the Google Chrome web browser, and Chrome OS, a lightweight operating system based on the Chrome browser",0
"Google has moved increasingly into hardware; from 2010 to 2015, it partnered with major electronics manufacturers in the production of its Nexus devices, and it released multiple hardware products in October 2016, including the Google Pixel smartphone, Google Home smart speaker, Google Wifi mesh wireless router, and Google Daydream virtual reality headset",0
"Google was the most valuable brand in the world as of 2017,[16] but has received significant criticism involving issues such as privacy concerns, tax avoidance, antitrust, censorship, and search neutrality",0
"
 
 Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford University in Stanford, California",0
"[17] The project initially involved an unofficial ""third founder"", Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Google Search engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a company;[18][19] Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006",0
"[20][21]
 
 While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites",0
"[22] They called this algorithm PageRank; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site",0
"[18]
 
 Page and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine ""BackRub"", because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site",0
[25][26][27] Hassan as well as Alan Steremberg were cited by Page and Brin as being critical to the development of Google,0
"Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd later co-authored with Page and Brin the first paper about the project, describing PageRank and the initial prototype of the Google search engine, published in 1998",0
"[28] PageRank was influenced by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring algorithm earlier used for RankDex, developed by Robin Li in 1996, with Larry Page's PageRank patent including a citation to Li's earlier RankDex patent; Li later went on to create the Chinese search engine Baidu",0
"[29][30][31]
 
 Eventually, they changed the name to Google; the name of the search engine originated from a misspelling of the word ""googol"",[32][33] the number 1 followed by 100 zeros, which was picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information",0
"[34]
 
 The domain name for Google was registered on September 15, 1997,[36] and the company was incorporated on September 4, 1998",0
"[17][37][38]
 
 Google was initially funded by an August 1998 contribution of $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems; the money was given before Google was incorporated",0
"[40] Between these initial investors, friends, and family Google raised around 1 million dollars, which is what allowed them to open up their original shop in Menlo Park, California",0
"[41]
 
 After some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999,[40] a new $25 million round of funding was announced on June 7, 1999,[42] with major investors including the venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital",0
"At that time Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt agreed to work together at Google for 20 years, until the year 2024",0
"[56][57] Shares were sold in an online auction format using a system built by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, underwriters for the deal",0
"[65]
 
 In 2005, The Washington Post reported on a 700 percent increase in third-quarter profit for Google, largely thanks to large companies shifting their advertising strategies from newspapers, magazines, and television to the Internet",0
"[54]
 
 On August 15, 2011, Google made its largest-ever acquisition to date when it announced that it would acquire Motorola Mobility for $12",0
"5 billion[68][69] This purchase was made in part to help Google gain Motorola's considerable patent portfolio on mobile phones and wireless technologies, to help protect Google in its ongoing patent disputes with other companies,[70] mainly Apple and Microsoft,[71] and to allow it to continue to freely offer Android",0
"[72]
 
 The year 2012 was the first time that Google generated $50 billion in annual revenue, generating $38 billion the previous year",0
And we hit $50 billion in revenues for the first time last year – not a bad achievement in just a decade and a half,0
"[74] While Waze would remain an independent entity, its social features, such as its crowdsourced location platform, were reportedly valuable integrations between Waze and Google Maps, Google's own mapping service",0
"[75]
 
 Google announced the launch of a new company, called Calico, on September 19, 2013, to be led by Apple Inc",0
"In the official public statement, Page explained that the ""health and well-being"" company would focus on ""the challenge of ageing and associated diseases""",0
"[76]
 
 On January 26, 2014, Google announced it had agreed to acquire DeepMind Technologies, a privately held artificial intelligence company from London",0
[77] Technology news website Recode reported that the company was purchased for $400 million though it was not disclosed where the information came from,0
"[80]
 
 According to Interbrand's annual Best Global Brands report, Google has been the second most valuable brand in the world (behind Apple Inc",0
"[90]
 
 On August 8, 2017, Google fired employee James Damore after he distributed a memo throughout the company which argued that bias and ""Google's ideological echo chamber"" clouded their thinking about diversity and inclusion, and that it is also biological factors, not discrimination alone, that cause the average woman to be less interested than men in technical positions",0
"[91] Google CEO Sundar Pichai accused Damore in violating company policy by ""advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace"", and he was fired on the same day",0
"[95][96]
 
 Between 2018 and 2019, tensions between the company's leadership and its workers escalated as staff protested company decisions on internal sexual harassment, a censored Chinese search engine, and a military drone artificial intelligence, which had been seen as areas of revenue growth for the company",0
"[97][98] On October 25, 2018, The New York Times published the exposé, ""How Google Protected Andy Rubin, the ‘Father of Android’""",0
"[99] On November 1, 2018, more than 20,000 Google employees and contractors staged a global walk-out to protest the company's handling of sexual harassment complaints",0
"[98]
 
 On March 19, 2019, Google announced that it would enter the video game market, launching a cloud gaming platform called Stadia",0
"[103]
 
 In December 2019, it was reported that former PayPal Chief Operating Officer Bill Ready would become Google's new commerce chief",0
"[104]
 
 In April 2020, it was reported that Google announced several cost-cutting measures as a response to the economic impact of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic",0
"Such measures included slowing down hiring for the remainder of 2020, except for of a small number of strategic areas, recalibrating the focus and pace of investments in areas like data centers and machines, and non-business essential marketing and travel",0
"[114] In addition to its own algorithms for understanding search requests, Google uses technology from the company DoubleClick, to project user interest and target advertising to the search context and the user history",0
"[117]
 
 Google Analytics allows website owners to track where and how people use their website, for example by examining click rates for all the links on a page",0
"[119] The sister service, Google AdSense, allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads are clicked",0
"[120] One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility of click fraud, which occurs when a person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product, causing the advertiser to pay money to Google unduly",0
"[121] Google Search Console (rebranded from Google Webmaster Tools in May 2015) allows webmasters to check the sitemap, crawl rate, and for security issues of their websites, as well as optimize their website's visibility",0
"[139] It spawned a number of phones and tablets under the ""Nexus"" branding[140] until its eventual discontinuation in 2016, replaced by a new brand called Pixel",0
"[143][144]
 
 In June 2014, Google announced Google Cardboard, a simple cardboard viewer that lets user place their smartphone in a special front compartment to view virtual reality (VR) media",0
"[147]
 Google Home, an Amazon Echo-like voice assistant placed in the house that can answer voice queries, play music, find information from apps (calendar, weather etc",0

 Daydream View virtual reality headset that lets Android users with compatible Daydream-ready smartphones put their phones in the headset and enjoy VR content",0
"[150]
 G Suite is a monthly subscription offering for organizations and businesses to get access to a collection of Google's services, including Gmail, Google Drive and Google Docs, Google Sheets and Google Slides, with additional administrative tools, unique domain names, and 24/7 support",0
"[151]
 
 On September 24, 2012,[152] Google launched Google for Entrepreneurs, a largely not-for-profit business incubator providing startups with co-working spaces known as Campuses, with assistance to startup founders that may include workshops, conferences, and mentorships",0
"
 
 On March 15, 2016, Google announced the introduction of Google Analytics 360 Suite, ""a set of integrated data and marketing analytics products, designed specifically for the needs of enterprise-class marketers"" which can be integrated with BigQuery on the Google Cloud Platform",0
"Among other things, the suite is designed to help ""enterprise class marketers"" ""see the complete customer journey"", generate ""useful insights"", and ""deliver engaging experiences to the right people""",0
"[154] Jack Marshall of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the suite competes with existing marketing cloud offerings by companies including Adobe, Oracle, Salesforce, and IBM",0
"[60] The stock performed well after the IPO, with shares hitting $350 for the first time on October 31, 2007,[169] primarily because of strong sales and earnings in the online advertising market",0
"[170] The surge in stock price was fueled mainly by individual investors, as opposed to large institutional investors and mutual funds",0
"[171] The company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbols GOOGL and GOOG, and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GGQ1",0
"Out of the five largest American technology companies, it pays the lowest taxes to the countries of origin of its revenues",0
"[177]
 
 Google said it overhauled its controversial global tax structure and consolidated all of its intellectual property holdings back to the US",0
"[178]
 
 Google Vice-President Matt Brittin testified to the Public Accounts Committee of the UK House of Commons that his UK sales team made no sales and hence owed no sales taxes to the UK",0
"[179] In January 2016, Google reached a settlement with the UK to pay £130m in back taxes plus higher taxes in future",0
"[182]
 he name ""Google"" originated from a misspelling of ""googol"",[183][184] which refers to the number represented by a 1 followed by one-hundred zeros",0
"Page and Brin write in their original paper on PageRank:[28] ""We chose our systems name, Google, because it is a common spelling of googol, or 10100 and fits well with our goal of building very large-scale search engines",0
"Having found its way increasingly into everyday language, the verb ""google"" was added to the Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary in 2006, meaning ""to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet",0
"[185][186] Google's mission statement, from the outset, was ""to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful"",[187] and its unofficial slogan is ""Don't be evil""",0
"[188] In October 2015, a related motto was adopted in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase: ""Do the right thing""",0
"[191] Since 1998, Google has been designing special, temporary alternate logos to place on their homepage intended to celebrate holidays, events, achievements and people",0
[192][193] The doodle was designed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin to notify users of their absence in case the servers crashed,0
"Subsequent Google Doodles were designed by an outside contractor, until Larry and Sergey asked then-intern Dennis Hwang to design a logo for Bastille Day in 2000",0
"Its first on April 1, 2000 was Google MentalPlex which allegedly featured the use of mental power to search the web",0

"[198]

[202][203] Google was also nominated in 2010 to be the world's most attractive employer to graduating students in the Universum Communications talent attraction index,0
"[204] Google's corporate philosophy includes principles such as ""you can make money without doing evil,"" ""you can be serious without a suit,"" and ""work should be challenging and the challenge should be fun",0
"[9] Google's 2017 diversity report states that 31 percent of its workforce are women and 69 percent are men, with the ethnicity of its workforce being predominantly white (56%) and Asian (35%)",0
"Employees are split into six hierarchies based on experience and can range ""from entry-level data center workers at level one to managers and experienced engineers at level six",0
"[207] As a motivation technique, Google uses a policy known as Innovation Time Off, where Google engineers are encouraged to spend 20% of their work time on projects that interest them",0
"[208] In a talk at Stanford University, Marissa Mayer, Google's Vice-President of Search Products and User Experience until July 2012, showed that half of all new product launches in the second half of 2005 had originated from the Innovation Time Off",0

"[253]
 
 In July 2010, Google signed an agreement with an Iowa wind farm to buy 114 megawatts of energy for 20 years",0

 In December 2016, Google announced that—starting in 2017—it will power all of its data centers, as well as all of its offices, from 100% renewable energy",0
"Google also stated that it does not count that as its final goal; it says that ""since the wind doesn't blow 24 hours a day, we'll also broaden our purchases to a variety of energy sources that can enable renewable power, every hour of every day""",0

"
 
 Google formerly adhered to the Internet censorship policies of China,[277] enforced by means of filters colloquially known as ""The Great Firewall of China"", but no longer does so",0

 Google has been involved in a number of lawsuits including the High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation which resulted in Google being one of four companies to pay a $415 million settlement to employees",0
"[292] Commenting on the penalty, New Scientist magazine said: ""The hefty sum – the largest ever doled out by the EU's competition regulators – will sting in the short term, but Google can handle it",0
The real impact of the ruling is that Google must stop using its dominance as a search engine to give itself the edge in another market: online price comparisons,0
The abuse of dominant position has been referred to Google's constraint applied on Android device manufacturers and network operators to ensure that traffic on Android devices goes to the Google search engine,0

However, keep in mind if backups have been made that contain the virus, other media or drives connected to the computer have a virus, your computer is connected to another computer on a network with a virus, and/or the virus is stored on some other type of software you use with your computer it can become re-infected if not properly protected.",0
Users should not simply press the power button or restart the computer while Windows is still running unless there is an issue with the computer. Microsoft has included the shut down feature because it enables a computer to go through all the necessary steps that are required before turning off the computer. In fact many versions of Microsoft Windows will check the computer for any problems if the computer is not shut down properly.,0
" Check that all the cables are securely plugged into the back of the machine and the monitor. Check that the power cables are plugged into a power socket and the socket has been turned on. Try using a different power socket or, if you are using a power extension strip, plug the power cable directly into a power socket in the wall. Replace the power cable with one that you know works. Check if there are any lights on at the front of the machine: If there are lights on the machine but not the monitor, then it's probably a monitor issue. If there are lights on the monitor but not the machine, then it's probably a machine issue. If there are no lights on anything, then it may be possible there is a local power cut. With laptops, try removing the power cable and the battery. Hold down the power button for about ten seconds, and then plug the battery and power cable in again. Press the power button to see if it switches on. ",0
" Try restarting your computer. Many basic problems can be resolved easily and quickly this way. Press the Ctrl & Alt & Del keys on your keyboard together at the same time. This should bring up a menu that will allow you to run Task Manager. In Task Manager, switch to the Applications tab. Highlight any programs with the status 'Not Responding' and choose End Task. You may be asked to confirm if you want to end the unresponsive program, so choose Yes. Do this for all programs that are not responding. If all else fails and you cannot shutdown/restart your computer, then hold down the power button on the machine until it forcibly turns off. Wait a few seconds and then turn it back on again. ",0
" First check the computer's power cord to make sure it is completely plugged into the wall socket. If you are using a plug strip, make sure it is completely plugged into the wall socket and that the power switch on the plug strip is turned on. Some plug strips also have a built in circuit breaker which usually looks like a black or red button near the power switch. Press the button to reset it and see if that solves the problem.",0
" When printing on untraditional paper your printer may experience smudges, un-even or crooked text, and/or text that runs off the edges of the paper. Your printer may be printing fuzzy, blurry, and/or other faint text because of dirty print heads. All modern printers have some type of printer cleaning, self-test, and/or diagnose mode that can be performed to check and clean the printers print heads and other internal equipment used to print.",0
" Make sure both the computer and monitor are on. Make sure the monitor is securely plugged into the computer. Make sure the power cable is firmly plugged into the monitor. Some computers have multiple display ports, so make sure you have plugged the monitor into the correct one. Try each one in turn, switching the monitor off then on in between moves. Most monitors have a status window displayed when you turn it on. Check if you can see this status window when you press the power button on the monitor. You can also try this with the menu button on the monitor, which should bring up an options menu on the screen. This shows the screen is working ok, so it may be an issue with the video cable from the monitor or the machine itself. Check the brightness & contrast levels of the monitor via the menu button, to make sure it has not been set too dark. Move the mouse and press any key on the keyboard to make sure the screensaver hasn't activated or that the computer hasn't gone into standby/hibernation mode.  ",0
" If you're running any version of Microsoft Windows and are encountering issues with the mouse wheel, first attempt to adjust the mouse settings through the Mouse Properties window. This window can be accessed by opening the Control Panel and double-clicking the Mouse icon.",0
" If the resolution was recently changed it is possible for the monitor to not auto adjust or shift to the correct size. If this occurs, the resolution can be changed back to the original setting or you can manually adjust the monitor. If a black border exists on the monitor it can generally be resolved by manually adjusting the horizontal or vertical width. Because each monitor is different, the method of adjusting this setting will vary; consult your monitor documentation.",0
" Make sure the monitor is on. If no power light (green or orange light) is seen on the monitor display try pressing the power button until it comes on. If your computer monitor was on and you stepped away from the computer and upon returning it was black, it's likely that the computer is asleep. Try moving your mouse, clicking the mouse buttons, and/or pressing any key (space bar) on the keyboard to wake it up. Make sure that the monitor is connected properly to the back of the computer.",0
" As with most computer errors, your first step is to shut down your computer and restart it. This will help you determine whether or not you actually have a hard disk problem. If the disk is severely damaged then your computer will probably fail to restart properly. If this is the case then contact MCWare IT Solutions, this is a job for the professionals.",0
" You may receive a distorted image when the cable is loose or defective. Disconnect the video cable going from the back of the computer and verify that no pins are bent, burnt or broken. Once verified re-connect the monitor cable. If the refresh rate is not properly set the monitor may have a wavy or an appearance that lines are going down or across the monitor slowly or fast, this may also cause a flickering affect. A distorted image can be caused by magnetic or other types of interference. Verify no speakers, fans or other magnetic devices are close to the monitor.",0
" There are many reasons why a computer may just stop working or """"freeze"""". Most of the time there isn't much we can do about it, it is a fact of life that computer programs have become so complex that occasionally users will experience problems even when performing common tasks. When your computer no longer responds to keyboard commands your best bet is to restart the computer.",0
" A computer virus is a software program that has been intentionally created to cause a user grief, spread to other computers, or destroy data on an individual's computer. To help prevent a computer from becoming infected by a virus, software developers have developed anti virus programs that stay active on the computer helping to protect it. It is important to realize that many computers do not come pre-loaded with these already installed and that if computers do come with these programs, the programs may expire within 90 days.",0
Users who have an optical mechanical mouse (most common mouse for desktop computers) are likely experiencing erratic behaviour because the mouse is not clean or is dirty. If you've cleaned the mouse and continue to encounter issues and this mouse has worked in the past fine unfortunately your mouse is likely defective. One additional test that can be done to help determine if this is the case or not is to connect the mouse to another computer. Otherwise we suggest replacing the mouse.,0

Together they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock,0
"[13] An initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex",0
"
 
 The company's rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, acquisitions, and partnerships beyond Google's core search engine (Google Search)",0
"It offers services designed for work and productivity (Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides), email (Gmail), scheduling and time management (Google Calendar), cloud storage (Google Drive), instant messaging and video chat (Duo, Hangouts), language translation (Google Translate), mapping and navigation (Google Maps, Waze, Google Earth, Street View), video sharing (YouTube), note-taking (Google Keep), and photo organizing and editing (Google Photos)",0
"The company leads the development of the Android mobile operating system, the Google Chrome web browser, and Chrome OS, a lightweight operating system based on the Chrome browser",0
"Google has moved increasingly into hardware; from 2010 to 2015, it partnered with major electronics manufacturers in the production of its Nexus devices, and it released multiple hardware products in October 2016, including the Google Pixel smartphone, Google Home smart speaker, Google Wifi mesh wireless router, and Google Daydream virtual reality headset",0
"Google was the most valuable brand in the world as of 2017,[16] but has received significant criticism involving issues such as privacy concerns, tax avoidance, antitrust, censorship, and search neutrality",0
"
 
 Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford University in Stanford, California",0
"[17] The project initially involved an unofficial ""third founder"", Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Google Search engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a company;[18][19] Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006",0
"[20][21]
 
 While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites",0
"[22] They called this algorithm PageRank; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site",0
"[18]
 
 Page and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine ""BackRub"", because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site",0
[25][26][27] Hassan as well as Alan Steremberg were cited by Page and Brin as being critical to the development of Google,0
"Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd later co-authored with Page and Brin the first paper about the project, describing PageRank and the initial prototype of the Google search engine, published in 1998",0
"[28] PageRank was influenced by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring algorithm earlier used for RankDex, developed by Robin Li in 1996, with Larry Page's PageRank patent including a citation to Li's earlier RankDex patent; Li later went on to create the Chinese search engine Baidu",0
"[29][30][31]
 
 Eventually, they changed the name to Google; the name of the search engine originated from a misspelling of the word ""googol"",[32][33] the number 1 followed by 100 zeros, which was picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information",0
"[34]
 
 The domain name for Google was registered on September 15, 1997,[36] and the company was incorporated on September 4, 1998",0
"[17][37][38]
 
 Google was initially funded by an August 1998 contribution of $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems; the money was given before Google was incorporated",0
"[40] Between these initial investors, friends, and family Google raised around 1 million dollars, which is what allowed them to open up their original shop in Menlo Park, California",0
"[41]
 
 After some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999,[40] a new $25 million round of funding was announced on June 7, 1999,[42] with major investors including the venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital",0
"At that time Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt agreed to work together at Google for 20 years, until the year 2024",0
"[56][57] Shares were sold in an online auction format using a system built by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, underwriters for the deal",0

"[54]
 
 On August 15, 2011, Google made its largest-ever acquisition to date when it announced that it would acquire Motorola Mobility for $12",0
"5 billion[68][69] This purchase was made in part to help Google gain Motorola's considerable patent portfolio on mobile phones and wireless technologies, to help protect Google in its ongoing patent disputes with other companies,[70] mainly Apple and Microsoft,[71] and to allow it to continue to freely offer Android",0
"[72]
 
 The year 2012 was the first time that Google generated $50 billion in annual revenue, generating $38 billion the previous year",0

"[90]
 
 On August 8, 2017, Google fired employee James Damore after he distributed a memo throughout the company which argued that bias and ""Google's ideological echo chamber"" clouded their thinking about diversity and inclusion, and that it is also biological factors, not discrimination alone, that cause the average woman to be less interested than men in technical positions",0
"[91] Google CEO Sundar Pichai accused Damore in violating company policy by ""advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace"", and he was fired on the same day",0
"[95][96]
 
 Between 2018 and 2019, tensions between the company's leadership and its workers escalated as staff protested company decisions on internal sexual harassment, a censored Chinese search engine, and a military drone artificial intelligence, which had been seen as areas of revenue growth for the company",0
"[97][98] On October 25, 2018, The New York Times published the exposé, ""How Google Protected Andy Rubin, the ‘Father of Android’""",0

"[117]
 
 Google Analytics allows website owners to track where and how people use their website, for example by examining click rates for all the links on a page",0
"[119] The sister service, Google AdSense, allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads are clicked",0
"[120] One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility of click fraud, which occurs when a person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product, causing the advertiser to pay money to Google unduly",0
"[121] Google Search Console (rebranded from Google Webmaster Tools in May 2015) allows webmasters to check the sitemap, crawl rate, and for security issues of their websites, as well as optimize their website's visibility",0

"Among other things, the suite is designed to help ""enterprise class marketers"" ""see the complete customer journey"", generate ""useful insights"", and ""deliver engaging experiences to the right people""",0
"[154] Jack Marshall of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the suite competes with existing marketing cloud offerings by companies including Adobe, Oracle, Salesforce, and IBM",0

"Page and Brin write in their original paper on PageRank:[28] ""We chose our systems name, Google, because it is a common spelling of googol, or 10100 and fits well with our goal of building very large-scale search engines",0
"Having found its way increasingly into everyday language, the verb ""google"" was added to the Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary in 2006, meaning ""to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet",0
"[185][186] Google's mission statement, from the outset, was ""to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful"",[187] and its unofficial slogan is ""Don't be evil""",0
"[188] In October 2015, a related motto was adopted in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase: ""Do the right thing""",0
"[191] Since 1998, Google has been designing special, temporary alternate logos to place on their homepage intended to celebrate holidays, events, achievements and people",0
[192][193] The doodle was designed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin to notify users of their absence in case the servers crashed,0
"Subsequent Google Doodles were designed by an outside contractor, until Larry and Sergey asked then-intern Dennis Hwang to design a logo for Bastille Day in 2000",0

[202][203] Google was also nominated in 2010 to be the world's most attractive employer to graduating students in the Universum Communications talent attraction index,0

 In July 2010, Google signed an agreement with an Iowa wind farm to buy 114 megawatts of energy for 20 years",0
"[254]
 
 In December 2016, Google announced that—starting in 2017—it will power all of its data centers, as well as all of its offices, from 100% renewable energy",0
"Google also stated that it does not count that as its final goal; it says that ""since the wind doesn't blow 24 hours a day, we'll also broaden our purchases to a variety of energy sources that can enable renewable power, every hour of every day""",0
"Additionally, the project will ""help support communities"" around the world, as the purchase commitments will ""result in infrastructure investments of more than $3",0
"5 billion globally"", and will ""generate tens of millions of dollars per year in revenue to local property owners, and tens of millions more to local and national governments in tax revenue""",0

"
 
 Google formerly adhered to the Internet censorship policies of China,[277] enforced by means of filters colloquially known as ""The Great Firewall of China"", but no longer does so",0
"As a result, all Google services except for Chinese Google Maps are blocked from access within mainland China without the aid of VPNs, proxy servers, or other similar technologies",0
"The Intercept reported in August 2018 that Google is developing for the People's Republic of China a censored version of its search engine (known as Dragonfly) ""that will blacklist websites and search terms about human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest""",0

 Google has been involved in a number of lawsuits including the High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation which resulted in Google being one of four companies to pay a $415 million settlement to employees",0
"[292] Commenting on the penalty, New Scientist magazine said: ""The hefty sum – the largest ever doled out by the EU's competition regulators – will sting in the short term, but Google can handle it",0
The real impact of the ruling is that Google must stop using its dominance as a search engine to give itself the edge in another market: online price comparisons,0
The abuse of dominant position has been referred to Google's constraint applied on Android device manufacturers and network operators to ensure that traffic on Android devices goes to the Google search engine,0

Users should not simply press the power button or restart the computer while Windows is still running unless there is an issue with the computer. Microsoft has included the shut down feature because it enables a computer to go through all the necessary steps that are required before turning off the computer. In fact many versions of Microsoft Windows will check the computer for any problems if the computer is not shut down properly.,0
" Check that all the cables are securely plugged into the back of the machine and the monitor. Check that the power cables are plugged into a power socket and the socket has been turned on. Try using a different power socket or, if you are using a power extension strip, plug the power cable directly into a power socket in the wall. Replace the power cable with one that you know works. Check if there are any lights on at the front of the machine: If there are lights on the machine but not the monitor, then it's probably a monitor issue. If there are lights on the monitor but not the machine, then it's probably a machine issue. If there are no lights on anything, then it may be possible there is a local power cut. With laptops, try removing the power cable and the battery. Hold down the power button for about ten seconds, and then plug the battery and power cable in again. Press the power button to see if it switches on. ",0
" Try restarting your computer. Many basic problems can be resolved easily and quickly this way. Press the Ctrl & Alt & Del keys on your keyboard together at the same time. This should bring up a menu that will allow you to run Task Manager. In Task Manager, switch to the Applications tab. Highlight any programs with the status 'Not Responding' and choose End Task. You may be asked to confirm if you want to end the unresponsive program, so choose Yes. Do this for all programs that are not responding. If all else fails and you cannot shutdown/restart your computer, then hold down the power button on the machine until it forcibly turns off. Wait a few seconds and then turn it back on again. ",0
" First check the computer's power cord to make sure it is completely plugged into the wall socket.

" When printing on untraditional paper your printer may experience smudges, un-even or crooked text, and/or text that runs off the edges of the paper.

" Make sure both the computer and monitor are on. Make sure the monitor is securely plugged into the computer. Make sure the power cable is firmly plugged into the monitor. Some computers have multiple display ports, so make sure you have plugged the monitor into the correct one. Try each one in turn, switching the monitor off then on in between moves. Most monitors have a status window displayed when you turn it on. Check if you can see this status window when you press the power button on the monitor. You can also try this with the menu button on the monitor, which should bring up an options menu on the screen. This shows the screen is working ok, so it may be an issue with the video cable from the monitor or the machine itself. Check the brightness & contrast levels of the monitor via the menu button, to make sure it has not been set too dark. Move the mouse and press any key on the keyboard to make sure the screensaver hasn't activated or that the computer hasn't gone into standby/hibernation mode.  ",0

If a black border exists on the monitor it can generally be resolved by manually adjusting the horizontal or vertical width. Because each monitor is different, the method of adjusting this setting will vary; consult your monitor documentation.",0
" Make sure the monitor is on. If no power light (green or orange light) is seen on the monitor display try pressing the power button until it comes on. If your computer monitor was on and you stepped away from the computer and upon returning it was black, it's likely that the computer is asleep. Try moving your mouse, clicking the mouse buttons, and/or pressing any key (space bar) on the keyboard to wake it up. Make sure that the monitor is connected properly to the back of the computer.",0

" You may receive a distorted image when the cable is loose or defective. Disconnect the video cable going from the back of the computer and verify that no pins are bent, burnt or broken. Once verified re-connect the monitor cable. If the refresh rate is not properly set the monitor may have a wavy or an appearance that lines are going down or across the monitor slowly or fast, this may also cause a flickering affect. A distorted image can be caused by magnetic or other types of interference. Verify no speakers, fans or other magnetic devices are close to the monitor.",0
" There are many reasons why a computer may just stop working or """"freeze"""". Most of the time there isn't much we can do about it, it is a fact of life that computer programs have become so complex that occasionally users will experience problems even when performing common tasks. When your computer no longer responds to keyboard commands your best bet is to restart the computer.",0
" A computer virus is a software program that has been intentionally created to cause a user grief, spread to other computers, or destroy data on an individual's computer. To help prevent a computer from becoming infected by a virus, software developers have developed anti virus programs that stay active on the computer helping to protect it. It is important to realize that many computers do not come pre-loaded with these already installed and that if computers do come with these programs, the programs may expire within 90 days.",0
Users who have an optical mechanical mouse (most common mouse for desktop computers) are likely experiencing erratic behaviour because the mouse is not clean or is dirty. If you've cleaned the mouse and continue to encounter issues and this mouse has worked in the past fine unfortunately your mouse is likely defective. One additional test that can be done to help determine if this is the case or not is to connect the mouse to another computer. Otherwise we suggest replacing the mouse.,0
