"[13] An initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex",0
"
 
 The company's rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, acquisitions, and partnerships beyond Google's core search engine (Google Search)",0
"It offers services designed for work and productivity (Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides), email (Gmail), scheduling and time management (Google Calendar), cloud storage (Google Drive), instant messaging and video chat (Duo, Hangouts), language translation (Google Translate), mapping and navigation (Google Maps, Waze, Google Earth, Street View), video sharing (YouTube), note-taking (Google Keep), and photo organizing and editing (Google Photos)",0
"The company leads the development of the Android mobile operating system, the Google Chrome web browser, and Chrome OS, a lightweight operating system based on the Chrome browser",0
"Google has moved increasingly into hardware; from 2010 to 2015, it partnered with major electronics manufacturers in the production of its Nexus devices, and it released multiple hardware products in October 2016, including the Google Pixel smartphone, Google Home smart speaker, Google Wifi mesh wireless router, and Google Daydream virtual reality headset",0
"Google was the most valuable brand in the world as of 2017,[16] but has received significant criticism involving issues such as privacy concerns, tax avoidance, antitrust, censorship, and search neutrality",0
"
 
 Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford University in Stanford, California",0
"[17] The project initially involved an unofficial ""third founder"", Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Google Search engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a company;[18][19] Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006",0
"[20][21]
 
 While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites",0
"[22] They called this algorithm PageRank; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site",0
"[18]
 
 Page and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine ""BackRub"", because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site",0
[25][26][27] Hassan as well as Alan Steremberg were cited by Page and Brin as being critical to the development of Google,0
"Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd later co-authored with Page and Brin the first paper about the project, describing PageRank and the initial prototype of the Google search engine, published in 1998",0
"[28] PageRank was influenced by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring algorithm earlier used for RankDex, developed by Robin Li in 1996, with Larry Page's PageRank patent including a citation to Li's earlier RankDex patent; Li later went on to create the Chinese search engine Baidu",0
"[29][30][31]
 
 Eventually, they changed the name to Google; the name of the search engine originated from a misspelling of the word ""googol"",[32][33] the number 1 followed by 100 zeros, which was picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information",0
"[34]
 
 The domain name for Google was registered on September 15, 1997,[36] and the company was incorporated on September 4, 1998",0

"[40] Between these initial investors, friends, and family Google raised around 1 million dollars, which is what allowed them to open up their original shop in Menlo Park, California",0
"[41]
 
 After some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999,[40] a new $25 million round of funding was announced on June 7, 1999,[42] with major investors including the venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital",0
"At that time Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt agreed to work together at Google for 20 years, until the year 2024",0

"5 billion[68][69] This purchase was made in part to help Google gain Motorola's considerable patent portfolio on mobile phones and wireless technologies, to help protect Google in its ongoing patent disputes with other companies,[70] mainly Apple and Microsoft,[71] and to allow it to continue to freely offer Android",0
"[72]

 On August 8, 2017, Google fired employee James Damore after he distributed a memo throughout the company which argued that bias and ""Google's ideological echo chamber"" clouded their thinking about diversity and inclusion, and that it is also biological factors, not discrimination alone, that cause the average woman to be less interested than men in technical positions",0
"[91] Google CEO Sundar Pichai accused Damore in violating company policy by ""advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace"", and he was fired on the same day",0
"[95][96]

"[119] The sister service, Google AdSense, allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads are clicked",0
"[120] One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility of click fraud, which occurs when a person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product, causing the advertiser to pay money to Google unduly",0
"[121] Google Search Console (rebranded from Google Webmaster Tools in May 2015) allows webmasters to check the sitemap, crawl rate, and for security issues of their websites, as well as optimize their website's visibility",0

" If the e-mail box is full of other e-mail messages, and/or your storage space is only a few megabytes, it's possible that the attachment being sent cannot be received. Often if this problem is occurring the person sending the e-mail should get a response back from your e-mail server indicating that your mailbox is full and/or has exceeded its allocated size. Because computer viruses and other malware are best distributed through e-mail, many e-mail service providers, companies, and e-mail programs prevent certain types of file extensions from being distributed or received through e-mail. For example, Microsoft Outlook protect its users by automatically disabling certain file extension types from being received in e-mail.",0

" A computer virus is a software program that has been intentionally created to cause a user grief, spread to other computers, or destroy data on an individual's computer. To help prevent a computer from becoming infected by a virus, software developers have developed anti virus programs that stay active on the computer helping to protect it. It is important to realize that many computers do not come pre-loaded with these already installed and that if computers do come with these programs, the programs may expire within 90 days.",0
Users who have an optical mechanical mouse (most common mouse for desktop computers) are likely experiencing erratic behaviour because the mouse is not clean or is dirty.
