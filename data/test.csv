At the end of the first week of 21-day nationwide lockdown, the district administration of Dimapur in Nagaland has ordered the total closure of all shops, commercial, private establishments, and imposed restrictions on movement of public and vehicles for 66 hours with effect from 6 am on Wednesday.

In exercise of powers under Disaster Management Act, 2005 and the Nagaland government order to initiate effective and immediate measures needed to contain the spread of coronavirus, total closure will be imposed from 6 am on April 1 to midnight of April 3, 2020, an order issued by Deputy Commissioner of Dimapur, Anoop Khinchi, said on Tuesday.

The containment measure will remain in force in the entire district, he said.

In a separate order, Commissioner of Police of Dimapur, Rothihu Tetseo, said that the situation calls for further strict restrictions on movement of public to ensure self-isolation and social distancing in public places as ordered by the state government.

He, however, said the Army, police, paramilitary forces, magistrates on duty, doctors and medical staff on duty, banks, treasury, power, PHED, telecom, vehicular transportation of essential commodities and media have been exempted from the purview of the restrictions.

People violating the order will be liable for punishment under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (disobeying public servant's lawful order), he said.

State government spokesperson for COVID-19 Neiba Kronu said the availability of food grains and essential commodities in the state continues to be normal.

He appealed to the people to stay at home and also urged them to strictly adhere to social distancing measures while shopping.

Kronu, also the Minister of Planning and Coordination and Land Revenue, said that during the lockdown period all kinds of gatherings, including religious congregations, are barred.

Mass gatherings have the potential to easily allow the spread of the virus, thereby putting the lives of many people in danger, he said."

He revealed that although he has no travel history to any of the COVID-19 affected places, he decided to self-quarantine as he was not present in his constituency during the initial days of the lockdown. ""So, l chose to stay in the farm for a few days to show my people how to quarantine oneself,"" he added.

Although in quarantine, the legislator distributed rice to people in his constituency at Tizit. Konyak told EastMojo that he has been engaging himself in collecting firewood, fetching water and planting areca nut plants even while in self-quarantine. He pointed that a few of his security personnel are also in quarantine with him, and that all are maintaining social distancing.

Making an appeal to the public to maintain social distancing and further abide by the rules and regulations, he said, ""We must trust and support the government at this moment and must all bear with humility for the good of oneself.”

As the world battles the deadly virus, Konyak optimiscally said, ""Everything happens for our good and God makes everything happen. I am grateful to be one with nature and also being able to meditate and plant crops.” He noted that he and those with him are all doing well, and remain fit and strong.

Mizoram deputy inspector general (Northern Range) Lalbiakthanga Khiangte said that security has been tightened along the state borders with Assam, Tripura and Manipur to check movement of people across the border.

The move follows the surge in novel coronavirus cases in neighbouring Assam, he said.

""We have alerted all check posts along the inter-state borders especially in Vairengte and Bairabi on the Mizoram-Assam border and Mamit district along the state border with Tripura,"" he said.

Khiangte said that they have reinforced the border check post in Mamit district to where one platoon of reinforcement has been sent on Thursday. He said that all the inter-state and international borders have been completely sealed barring Vairengte in Kolasib district in the wake of the rapidly increasing coronavirus spread.

""We have instructed our men and medical team at Vairengte to conduct strict medical screening of essential commodities besides passengers,"" he said.

Police personnel were on guard in at least 54 duty posts along the inter-state and international borders and 205 places across the state.

Khiangte said that policemen would also involved in all the duty posts along inter-state and international borders, which were earlier manned by local level task forces.

According to the police officer, the state police have identified at least 32 people from the state, who were believed to be present near or within a diametre of 250-500 meters from a religious congregation in Delhi's Nizamuddin based on the digital footprints issued by intelligent department.

He said that all of them were put under home quarantine and were asymptomatic. ""The matter has been referred to the health department for further action,"" he said.

Meawnhile, Kolasib deputy commissioner H Lalthlangliana said an essential commodities monitoring cell has been formed to monitor supply and ensure safety of essential commodities.

He said that the district administration stepped up screening along the state border with Assam as a containment measure.

Amid the controversial issue about a religious congregation at Nizammuddin in Delhi, at least 15 people have tested positive for novel coronavirus in Assam on Wednesday raising the toll to 16.

All the infected patients were linked to the Nizamuddin event, Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had said. Manipur also reported one more case on Wednesday after it had detected the first one on March 24.

Tripura has not reported any confirmed case of coronavirus till date, sources said."

Discussion: What is difference in Droplet Transmission And Airborne?

When we speak, cough or sneeze, our saliva comes out in form of spray. It can go upto distance of one metre. If there is any infective organism in saliva, it will also come out. Depending on the size of organism, some will fall down immediately after coming out from the mouth, others which are smaller in size can travel upto some distance and may remain suspended in close distance for sometime. This is transmission through droplets.

Current evidence suggests that Corona viruses ( Covid 19) gets transmitted by droplets.

However, sometimes, these droplets get dried. Organisms in these droplets become very light when the moisture around them gets dried up. Such light weight organisms can get drifted with air current for long distances. This is called airborne transmission.

So far, there is no evidence that Corona gets airborne.

Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low. 

https://www.mohfw.gov.in/

Discussion
This is a common query by many. We receive milk packets, vegetables, fruits, groceries, news paper etc. All these can be contaminated. What to do?
As explained by Govt. of India, chances are low but not nil.
As on today less than 2000 people are confirmed covid 19 positive. Even if there are another 10000 positives who could not be detected, chances that people distributing such supplies would be infected are very less. But still not zero. This risk will increase when more and more population will be infected.
Despite this, preventive measures remain standard.
On receipt of supplies discard outer container, bag if possible.
Wash vegetables and fruits thoroughly in running water.
While reading newspaper, donot touch your hand on face . Wash your hands with soap and water at the end of any process.

The ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating.

Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?”

Discussion: What is difference in Droplet Transmission And Airborne?

When we speak, cough or sneeze, our saliva comes out in form of spray. It can go upto distance of one metre. If there is any infective organism in saliva, it will also come out. Depending on the size of organism, some will fall down immediately after coming out from the mouth, others which are smaller in size can travel upto some distance and may remain suspended in close distance for sometime. This is transmission through droplets.

Current evidence suggests that Corona viruses ( Covid 19) gets transmitted by droplets.

However, sometimes, these droplets get dried. Organisms in these droplets become very light when the moisture around them gets dried up. Such light weight organisms can get drifted with air current for long distances. This is called airborne transmission.

So far, there is no evidence that Corona gets airborne."
