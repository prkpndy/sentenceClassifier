"<p>Is there a simple way to make a nice plot of the following data in R, without using many commands?</p>

<pre><code> Region1 Region2
2007 17 55
2008 26 43
2009 53 70
2010 96 58
</code></pre>

<p>I do know how to plot the data, but it uses too many commands and parameters, and the result still looks absolutely terrible (see <a href=""""http://i50.tinypic.com/30nklfm.png"""" rel=""""nofollow noreferrer"""">here</a>):</p>

<pre><code>&gt; test &lt;- read.table(""""/tmp/data.txt"""")
&gt; png(filename=""""/tmp/test.png"""", height=1000, width=750, bg=""""white"""", res=300)
&gt; plot(test$Region1, type=""""b"""", col=""""blue"""", ylim=c(0,100), lwd=3)
&gt; lines(test$Region2, type=""""b"""", col=""""red"""", lwd=3)
&gt; dev.off()
</code></pre>

<p>It took me a while to figure out all the commands, and I still have to get the x axis labels (2007, 2008, ...), using the <code>axis</code> command (but how do I access the <code>test</code> x axis labels?), etc. </p>

<p>In Keynote (or Powerpoint) I can just give it the same table (transposed) and it produces a nice graph from it (see <a href=""""http://i45.tinypic.com/b3tw08.jpg"""" rel=""""nofollow noreferrer"""">here</a>).</p>

<p>My question is really: Is there a higher-level command that draws such typical data nicely? Also, how can I separate the drawing logic (draw 2 lines from that specific data, etc.) from the layout (use specific colors and line types for the graph, etc.)? Ideally, I'd hope there were different libraries for different layouts of the graph, e.g. called <code>NiceKeynoteLayout</code>, which I just could use like this (or similar):</p>

<pre><code>&gt; d &lt;- read.table(""""/tmp/data.txt"""")
&gt; png &lt;- png(filename=""""/tmp/test.png"""", height=1000, width=750)
&gt; myLayout &lt;- loadPredefinedLayout(""""NiceKeynoteLayout"""")
&gt; coolplot(d, layout=myLayout, out=png)

"<p>I'm trying to import some data into R and not having much luck grouping together rows of related data. </p>

Each variable is analysed in terms of some simple statistics: min, max, mean, stddev.</p>

<p>So, my input data has the form:</p>

<pre><code>      Min  Max  Mean  StdDev

<p>I realize I can create a cron job to run the R scripts on the webserver to create the plots daily to be viewed from the website as images.

"<p>I have a dataset in R, which contains the results of a rapid diagnostic test.  The test has a visible line if it is working properly (control line) and a visible line for each of the two parasite species it detects, if they are present in the patient sample.</p>

(database is called RDTbase)</p>

<pre><code>   Control  Pf    Pv
1. TRUE     TRUE  FALSE

<p>I would like to add a new column which contains a single result for each rapid test.  The results are designated according to the different logical conditions met by the three lines.  For the example above the new column would look like this:</p>

1. TRUE  TRUE   FALSE  Pf
2. TRUE  FALSE  TRUE   Pv
3. FALSE FALSE  FALSE  Invalid
4. TRUE  TRUE   TRUE   Mixed
5. TRUE  FALSE  FALSE  Negative

<p>I am able to create the new column, but it takes a lot of coding and I think there has to be a much simpler (and shorter) way to do this.</p>

<p>Here is my current (long) method:</p>

R.mix &lt;- RDTbase[which(Control == """"TRUE"""" &amp; Pf == """"TRUE"""" &amp; Pv == """"TRUE""""),]
R.neg &lt;- RDTbase[which(Control == """"TRUE"""" &amp; Pf == """"FALSE"""" &amp; Pv == """"FALSE""""),]

"<p>Brief background: Many (most?) contemporary programming languages in widespread use have at least a handful of ADTs [abstract data types] in common, in particular,</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>string</strong> (a sequence comprised of characters)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>list</strong> (an ordered collection of values), and</p></li>
<li><p><strong>map-based type</strong> (an unordered array that maps keys to values)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In the R programming language, the first two are implemented as <code>character</code> and <code>vector</code>, respectively.</p>

<p>When I began learning R, two things were obvious almost from the start: <code>list</code> is the most important data type in R (because it is the parent class for the R <code>data.frame</code>), and second, I just couldn't understand how they worked, at least not well enough to use them correctly in my code.</p>

<p>For one thing, it seemed to me that R's <code>list</code> data type was a straightforward implementation of the map ADT (<code>dictionary</code> in Python, <code>NSMutableDictionary</code> in Objective C, <code>hash</code> in Perl and Ruby, <code>object literal</code> in Javascript, and so forth).</p>

<p>For instance, you create them just like you would a Python dictionary, by passing key-value pairs to a constructor (which in Python is <code>dict</code> not <code>list</code>):</p>

<pre><code>x = list(""""ev1""""=10, """"ev2""""=15, """"rv""""=""""Group 1"""")
</code></pre>

<p>And you access the items of an R List just like you would those of a Python dictionary, e.g., <code>x['ev1']</code>. Likewise, you can retrieve just the <em>'keys'</em> or just the <em>'values'</em> by: </p>

<pre><code>names(x)    # fetch just the 'keys' of an R list
# [1] """"ev1"""" """"ev2"""" """"rv""""

unlist(x)   # fetch just the 'values' of an R list
#   ev1       ev2        rv 
#  """"10""""      """"15"""" """"Group 1"""" 

x = list(""""a""""=6, """"b""""=9, """"c""""=3)  

sum(unlist(x))
# [1] 18
</code></pre>

<p>but R <code>list</code>s are also <strong><em>unlike</em></strong> other map-type ADTs (from among the languages I've learned anyway). My guess is that this is a consequence of the initial spec for S, i.e., an intention to design a data/statistics DSL [domain-specific language] from the ground-up. </p>

<p><em>three</em> significant differences between R <code>list</code>s and mapping types in other languages in widespread use (e.g,. Python, Perl, JavaScript):</p>

<p><em>first</em>, <code>list</code>s in R are an <em>ordered</em> collection, just like vectors, even though the values are keyed (ie, the keys can be any hashable value not just sequential integers). Nearly always, the mapping data type in other languages is <em>unordered</em>.</p>

<p><em>second</em>, <code>list</code>s can be returned from functions even though you never passed in a <code>list</code> when you called the function, and <em>even though</em> the function that returned the <code>list</code> doesn't contain an (explicit) <code>list</code> constructor (Of course, you can deal with this in practice by wrapping the returned result in a call to <code>unlist</code>):</p>

<pre><code>x = strsplit(LETTERS[1:10], """""""")     # passing in an object of type 'character'

class(x)                            # returns 'list', not a vector of length 2
# [1] list
</code></pre>

<p>A <em>third</em> peculiar feature of R's <code>list</code>s: it doesn't seem that they can be members of another ADT, and if you try to do that then the primary container is coerced to a <code>list</code>. E.g.,</p>

<pre><code>x = c(0.5, 0.8, 0.23, list(0.5, 0.2, 0.9), recursive=TRUE)

class(x)
# [1] list
</code></pre>

<p>my intention here is not to criticize the language or how it is documented; likewise, I'm not suggesting there is anything wrong with the <code>list</code> data structure or how it behaves. All I'm after is to correct is my understanding of how they work so I can correctly use them in my code. </p>

<p>Here are the sorts of things I'd like to better understand:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What are the rules which determine when a function call will return a <code>list</code> (e.g., <code>strsplit</code> expression recited above)?</p></li>
<li><p>If I don't explicitly assign names to a <code>list</code> (e.g., <code>list(10,20,30,40)</code>) are the default names just sequential integers beginning with 1?  (I assume, but I am far from certain that the answer is yes, otherwise we wouldn't be able to coerce this type of <code>list</code> to a vector w/ a call to <code>unlist</code>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Why do these two different operators, <code>[]</code>, and <code>[[]]</code>, return the <em>same</em> result?</p>

<p><code>x = list(1, 2, 3, 4)</code></p>

<p>both expressions return """"1"""":</p>

<p><code>x[1]</code></p>

<p><code>x[[1]]</code></p></li>
<li><p>why do these two expressions <strong>not</strong> return the same result?</p>

<p><code>x = list(1, 2, 3, 4)</code></p>

<p><code>x2 = list(1:4)</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Please don't point me to the R Documentation (<a href=""""http://www.inside-r.org/r-doc/base/list"""" rel=""""nofollow noreferrer""""><code>?list</code></a>, <a href=""""http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-intro.html#Lists"""" rel=""""nofollow noreferrer""""><code>R-intro</code></a>)--I have read it carefully and it does not help me answer the type of questions I recited just above.</p>

<p>(lastly, I recently learned of and began using an R Package (available on CRAN) called <a href=""""http://mran.revolutionanalytics.com/packages/info/?hash"""" rel=""""nofollow noreferrer""""><code>hash</code></a> which implements <em>conventional</em> map-type behavior via an S4 class; I can certainly recommend this Package.)</p>

beta &lt;- seq(0, 1)
classifier.out &lt;- classifier(training.data, labels)
outer(X=alpha, Y=beta, FUN=""""predict"""", classifier.out, validation.data)
</code></pre>

<p>This is a problem because <strong>alpha</strong> and <strong>beta</strong> are not the first two parameters in <strong>predict</strong>.</p>

<p>So, in order to get around this, I changed the last line to</p>

<pre><code>outer(X=alpha, Y=beta, FUN=""""predict"""", object=classifier.out, data=validation.data)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that my validation data has 40 observations, and also that there are 4 possible pairs of <strong>alpha</strong> and <strong>beta</strong>. I get an error though saying</p>

<pre><code>dims [product 4] do not match the length of object [40]
</code></pre>

"<p>I like the plyr syntax. Any time I have to use one of the *apply() commands I end up kicking the dog and going on a 3 day bender. So for the sake of my dog and my liver, what's concise syntax for doing a ddply operation on every row of a data frame?</p>

<p>Here's an example that works well for a simple case:</p>

<pre><code>x &lt;- rnorm(10)
y &lt;- rnorm(10)
df &lt;- data.frame(x,y)
ddply(df,names(df) ,function(df) max(df$x,df$y))
</code></pre>

<p>that works fine and gives me what I want. But if things get more complex this causes plyr to get funky (and not like Bootsy Collins) because plyr is chewing on making """"levels"""" out of all those floating point values</p>

<pre><code>x &lt;- rnorm(1000)
y &lt;- rnorm(1000)
z &lt;- rnorm(1000)
myLetters &lt;- sample(letters, 1000, replace=T)
df &lt;- data.frame(x,y, z, myLetters)
ddply(df,names(df) ,function(df) max(df$x,df$y))
</code></pre>

<p>on my box this chews for a few minutes and then returns:</p>

<pre><code>Error: memory exhausted (limit reached?)
In addition: Warning messages:
1: In paste(rep(l, each = ll), rep(lvs, length(l)), sep = sep) :
  Reached total allocation of 1535Mb: see help(memory.size)
2: In paste(rep(l, each = ll), rep(lvs, length(l)), sep = sep) :
  Reached total allocation of 1535Mb: see help(memory.size)
</code></pre>

<p>I think I am totally abusing plyr and I am not saying this is a bug in plyr, but rather abusive behavior by me (liver and dog notwithstanding).</p>

<p>So in short, is there syntax shortcut for using ddply to operate on every row as a substitute for <code>apply(X, 1, ...)</code>?</p>

<p>The workaround I've been using is to create a """"key"""" that gives a unique value for every row and then I can join back to it. </p>

"<p>One of the most important issues in using factor analysis is its interpretation. Factor analysis often uses factor rotation to enhance its interpretation. After a satisfactory rotation, the rotated factor loading matrix <strong>L'</strong> will have the same ability to represent the correlation matrix and it can be used as the factor loading matrix, instead of the unrotated matrix <strong>L</strong>.</p>

<p>The purpose of rotation is to make the rotated factor loading matrix have some desirable properties. One of the methods used is to rotate the factor loading matrix such that the rotated matrix will have a <strong>simple structure</strong>.</p>

<p>L. L. Thurstone introduced the Principle of Simple Structure, as a general guide for factor rotation:</p>

<h2>Simple Structure Criteria:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Each row of the factor matrix should contain at least one zero</li>
<li>If there are m common factors, each column of the factor matrix should have at least m zeros</li>
<li>For every pair of columns in the factor matrix, there should be several variables for which entries approach zero in the one column but not in the other</li>
<li>For every pair of columns in the factor matrix, a large proportion of the variables should have entries approaching zero in both columns when there are four or more factors</li>
<li>For every pair of columns in the factor matrix, there should be only a small number of variables with nonzero entries in both columns</li>
</ol>

<p>The ideal simple structure is such that:</p>

<ol>
<li>each item has a high, or meaningful, loading on one factor only and</li>
<li>each factor have high, or meaningful, loadings for only some of the items.</li>
</ol>

<p>The problem is that, trying several combinations of rotation methods along with the parameters that each one accepts (especially for oblique ones), the number of candidate matrices increases and it is very difficult to see which one better meets the above criteria.</p>

<p>When I first faced that problem I realized that I was unable to select the best match by merely 'looking' at them, and that I needed an algorithm to help me decide. Under the stress of project's deadlines, the most I could do was to write the following code in MATLAB, which accepts one rotation matrix at a time and returns (under some assumptions) whether each criterion is met or not.
A new version (If I would ever tried to upgrade it) would accept a 3d matrix (a set of 2d matrices) as an argument, and the algorithm should return the one that better fits the above criteria.</p>

<p>I am just asking for your opinions (I also think that there's been criticism over the usefulness of the method by itself) and perhaps better approaches to the rotation matrix selection problem. If someone wants to provide some code, I would prefer R or MATLAB. </p>

<p>P.S. The above <a href=""""http://books.google.gr/books?id=5Jyaa2LQWbQC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;lpg=PA132&amp;dq=%22The+criteria+of+simple+structure+was+originally+proposed%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OXsCeU0Nzi&amp;sig=qfiLMUyXsgwPunWBgNdSEeBNm34&amp;hl=el&amp;ei=huZeS5nkApTE4gaC67HsCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20criteria%20of%20simple%20structure%20was%20originally%20proposed%22&amp;f=false"""" rel=""""nofollow noreferrer"""">Simple Structure Criteria formulation</a> can be found in the book <em>""""Making Sense of Factor Analysis""""</em> by PETT, M., LACKEY, N., SULLIVAN, J.</p>

<p>P.S.2 (from the same book): <em>""""A test of successful factor analysis is the extent to which it can reproduce the original corr matrix. If you also used oblique solutions, among all select the one that generated the greatest number of highest and lowest factor loadings.""""</em> 
This sounds like another constraint that the algorithm could use.</p>

"<p>I'm using the SQlite package to interface with a database from R. However, I'm running into the issue that the results from exactly the same query are different when I run it in R or from the command-line interface. 
For instance, the minimum value in a column is 0, but R somehow gives the result -2147332296. As I just copy-n-paste the query, I don't think the problem is in the query. The only thing I can think of is that there might be a problem with conversion between datatypes. The maximum value in that same column is 147031553000 and the type of the column is """"integer"""". Perhaps this value is too big for the datatype which R uses and this results in the negative value?</p>

<p>However, there is one more problem. For the same query, R reports less results than when I run the query in the command-line interface. Does anyone here have an idea as to why things might be going wrong?</p>

"<p>I'm working on a project now that's rather unlike anything I've done before.  I have two tests with binary results that will be administered to the same sample, which is drawn from a clustered population (i.e., some subjects will be from the same family).  I'd like to compare proportions of positive test results, but the clustering makes McNemar's test inappropriate so I've been reading up on alternative approaches.  The two main routes seem to be 1) the clustering-adjusted McNemar alternatives by Rao and Scott (1992), Eliasziw and Donner (1991), and Obuchowski (1998), and 2) GEE.</p>

<p>Do you know of any implementations of the Rao-Obuchowski lineage in R (or, I suppose, SAS)?  GEE is easy to find, but have you had a positive or negative experience with any particular packages?  Is there another route to analyzing these data that I'm completely missing?</p>

"<p>In R's <code>DBI</code> package, I'm not finding a facility for using bound variables.

<p>What do people in R use for a substitute?  Just concatenate strings right into the SQL?  That's got some obvious problems for safety &amp; performance.</p>

<p>That's not a very well-thought-out interface, but the idea is that you can use a value for <code>bind</code> and the driver handles the details of escaping (if the underlying API doesn't handle bound variables natively) without the caller having to reimplement it [badly].</p>

<p>So far the loop approach works fine. However, it looks pretty inefficient and I am wondering if there is a faster and easier approach.</p>

<p>Here is the scenario:
I have a directory with several <code>.csv</code> files. Each file contains the same identifier which can be used as the merger variable. Since the files are rather large in size I thought to read each file one at a time into R instead of reading all files at once.
So I get all the files of the directory with <code>list.files</code> and read in the first two files. Afterwards I use <code>merge</code> to get one <code>data.frame</code>.</p>

dataMerge &lt;- merge(FirstFile, SecondFile, by=c(""""COUNTRYNAME"""", """"COUNTRYCODE"""", """"Year""""),
             all=T)
</code></pre>

<p>Now I use a <code>for</code> loop to get all the remaining <code>.csv</code> files and <code>merge</code> them into the already existing <code>data.frame</code>:</p>

<pre><code>for(i in 3:length(FileNames)){ 
ReadInMerge &lt;- read.csv(file=paste("""".../tempDataFolder/"""", FileNames[i], sep=""""""""),

dataMerge &lt;- merge(dataMerge, ReadInMerge, by=c(""""COUNTRYNAME"""", """"COUNTRYCODE"""", """"Year""""),

"<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong> </p>

<p>I have two datasets with information that I need to merge. The only common fields that I have are strings that do not perfectly match and a numerical field that can be substantially different </p>

<p>The only way to explain the problem is to show you the data. Here is <a href=""""http://bertelsen.ca/R/a.csv"""" rel=""""nofollow noreferrer"""">a.csv</a> and <a href=""""http://bertelsen.ca/R/b.csv"""" rel=""""nofollow noreferrer"""">b.csv</a>. I am trying to merge B to A.</p>

<p>There are three fields in B and four in A. Company Name (File A Only), Fund Name, Asset Class, and Assets. So far, my focus has been on attempting to match the Fund Names by replacing words or parts of the strings to create exact matches and then using: </p>

<pre><code>a &lt;- read.table(file = """"http://bertelsen.ca/R/a.csv"""",header=TRUE, sep="""","""", na.strings=F, strip.white=T, blank.lines.skip=F, stringsAsFactors=T) 
b &lt;- read.table(file = """"http://bertelsen.ca/R/b.csv"""",header=TRUE, sep="""","""", na.strings=F, strip.white=T, blank.lines.skip=F, stringsAsFactors=T)
merge(a,b, by=""""Fund.Name"""") 
</code></pre>

<p>However, this only brings me to about 30% matching. The rest I have to do by hand. </p>

<p>Assets is a numerical field that is not always correct in either and can vary wildly if the fund has low assets. Asset Class is a string field that is """"generally"""" the same in both files, however, there are discrepancies. </p>

<p>Adding to the complication are the different series of funds, in File B. For example: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AGF Canadian Value </p>
  
  <p>AGF Canadian Value-D</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In these cases, I have to choose the one that is not seried, or choose the one that is called """"A"""", """"-A"""", or """"Advisor"""" as the match. </p>

<p><strong>QUESTION</strong></p>

<p>What would you say is the best approach? This excercise is something that I have to do on a monthly basis and matching them manually is incredibly time consuming. Examples of code would be instrumental. </p>

<p><strong>IDEAS</strong></p>

<p>One method that I think may work is normalizing the strings based on the first capitalized letter of each word in the string. But I haven't been able to figure out how to pull that off using R.</p>

<p>Another method I considered was creating an index of matches based on a combination of assets, fund name, asset class and company. But again, I'm not sure how to do this with R. Or, for that matter, if it's even possible.</p>

<p>Examples of code, comments, thoughts and direction are greatly appreciated!   </p>

"<p>I'm using R, and I'm a beginner. I have two large lists (30K elements each). One is called <code>descriptions</code> and where each element is (maybe) a tokenized string. The other is called <code>probes</code> where each element is a number. I need to make a dictionary that maps<code>probes</code> to something in <code>descriptions</code>, if that something is there. Here's how I'm going about this:</p>

<pre><code>probe2gene &lt;- list()
for (i in 1:length(probes)){
 strings&lt;-strsplit(descriptions[i]), '//')
 if (length(strings[[1]]) &gt; 1){ 
  probe2gene[probes[i]] = strings[[1]][2]
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which works fine, but seems slow, much slower than the roughly equivalent python:</p>

<pre><code>probe2gene = {}
for p,d in zip(probes, descriptions):
    try:
     probe2gene[p] = descriptions.split('//')[1]
    except IndexError:
     pass
</code></pre>

<p>My question: is there an """"R-thonic"""" way of doing what I'm trying to do? The <a href=""""http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.html#Repetitive-execution"""" rel=""""nofollow noreferrer"""">R manual entry on for loops</a> suggests that such loops are rare. Is there a better solution?</p>

<p>Edit: a typical good """"description"""" looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>""""NM_009826 // Rb1cc1 // RB1-inducible coiled-coil 1 // 1 A2 // 12421 /// AB070619 // Rb1cc1 // RB1-inducible coiled-coil 1 // 1 A2 // 12421 /// ENSMUST00000027040 // Rb1cc1 // RB1-inducible coiled-coil 1 // 1 A2 // 12421""""
</code></pre>

<p>a bad """"description: looks like this</p>

<pre><code>""""-----""""
</code></pre>

<p>though it can quite easily be some other not-very-helpful string. Each probe is simply a number. The <code>probe</code> and <code>description</code> vectors are the same length, and completely correspond to each other, i.e. <code>probe[i]</code> maps to <code>description[i]</code>.</p>

"<p>I have a process in R that creates a bunch of objects, serializes them, and puts them into plain text files. This seemed like a really good way to handle things since I am working with Hadoop and all output needs to stream through stdin and stdout. </p>

<p>The problem I am left with is how to read these objects out of the text file and back into R on my desktop machine. Here's a working example that illustrates the challenge:</p>

<p>Let's create a tmp file and write a single object into it. This object is just a vector:</p>

<pre><code>outCon &lt;- file(""""c:/tmp"""", """"w"""")
mychars &lt;- rawToChar(serialize(1:10, NULL, ascii=T))
cat(mychars, file=outCon)
close(outCon)
</code></pre>

<p>The mychars object looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; mychars
[1] """"A\n2\n133633\n131840\n13\n10\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n""""
</code></pre>

<p>when written to the text file it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>A
2
133633
131840
13
10
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
</code></pre>

<p>I'm probably overlooking something terribly obvious, but how do I read this file back into R and unserialize the object? When I try scan() or readLines() both want to treat the new line characters as record delimiters and I end up with a vector where each element is a row from the text file. What I really want is a text string with the whole contents of the file. Then I can unserialize the string. </p>

<p>Perl will read line breaks back into a string, but I can't figure out how to override the way R treats line breaks. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1266279/how-to-organize-large-r-programs"""">How to organize large R programs?</a></li>

</ul>

<p><strong>A Long Update To The Question</strong>: Following some of the people's answers, and Dirk's question in the comment, I would like to direct my question a bit more.</p>

<p>After reading the Wiki article about """"<a href=""""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control"""" rel=""""nofollow noreferrer"""">revision control</a>"""" (which I was previously not familiar with), it was clear to me that when using revision control, what one does is to build a <strong>development structure</strong> of his code. This structure either leads to a """"final product"""" or to several branches.</p>

<p>When building something like, let's say, a website. There is usually one end product you work towards (the website), with some prototypes along the way.</p>

<p>But when doing a statistical analysis, the work (to my view) is different. Sometimes you know where you want to get to. But more often, you explore. Explore cleaning the dataset. Explore different methods for statistical analysis, and ask various questions of your data (and I am writing this, knowing how Frank Harrell, and other experience statisticians feels about <a href=""""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging"""" rel=""""nofollow noreferrer"""">Data dredging</a>).</p>

<p>That is why the workflow question with statistical programming is (in my view) a serious and deep question, raising many issues, The simpler ones are technical:</p>

<ul>
<li>Which revision control software do you use (and why) ?</li>
<li>Which IDE do you use(and why) ? 
The more interesting question are about work process:</li>
<li>How do you structure your files?</li>
<li>What do you keep as a separate file and what as a revision? or asking in a different way - What should be a """"branch"""" and what should be a """"sub project"""" in your code? For example: When starting to explore your data, should a plot be creating and then erased because it didn't lead any where (but kept as a revision) or should there be a backup file of that path?</li>
</ul>

<p>How <strong>you</strong> solve this tension was my initial curiosity. The second question is """"what might I be missing?"""". What rules (of thumb) should one follow so to avoid common pitfalls doing statistical programming with version control?</p>

<p>In my <strong>intuition</strong>, I feel that statistical programming is inherently different then software development (I am writing this without being a real expert in statistical programming, and even less so in software development). That's way I am unsure which of the lessons I have read here about version control would be applicable.</p>

    bslices = seq (from = 5000, to = 30000, by = 5000)
    length (bslices)
    xyplot (csalary ~ bsalary,

  Ultimately, my question is how to turn raw scatterplot data into conditionally-grouped data. I feel like there are some simple, underlying features of lattice (or even the simpler plot commands that don't require it) that would allow me to start slicing my data to explore for patterns.

<p>How do I simply add another series, e.g. plotting the cost of rubies against diamonds.  Assuming rubies was also in the diamonds dataset.  I have tried to lay over the top another layer with the rubies data, but it just plots the rubies and not the diamonds/carat.</p>

"<p>I have a simple program that breaks a dataset (a CSV file) into 4 chunks, reads each chunk in, does some calculations, and then appends the output together.  Think of it as a simple map-reduce operation.  Processing a single chunk uses about 1GB of memory.  I'm running the program on a quad core PC, with 4GB of ram, running Windows XP.  I happen to have coded it up using R, but I don't think it's relevant.</p>

<p>I coded up two versions.  One version processes each chunk in sequence.  The other version processes chunks two at a time in parallel.  Both versions take nearly the same amount of time to finish.</p>

<p>Under what circumstances would you expect to see this performance result?</p>

<p>My current hypothesis is that the processes are bounded by the memory performance, but I don't know the best way to investigate this further.  Any suggestions or guesses?</p>

<p>Edit: The program is not IO-bound in terms of the disk.  The processing step reads a chunk of a CSV file into memory, churns on it for 5 minutes or so, and then writes the result back out to a file on disk.  The file input and output takes a few seconds at most.</p>

"<p>I have the following setup to analyse:
We have about 150 subjects, and for each subject we performed a pair of tests (under different conditions) 18 times.
The 18 different conditions of the test are complementary, in such a way so that if we where to average over the tests (for each subject), we would get no correlation between the tests (between subjects).
What we wish to know is the correlation (and P value) between the tests, in within subjects, but over all the subjects.</p>

<p>The way I did this by now was to perform the correlation for each subject, and then look at the distribution of the correlations received so to see if it's mean is different then 0.
But I suspect there might be a better way for answering the same question (someone said to me something about """"geographical correlation"""", but a shallow search didn't help).</p>

<p>I have <code>data.frame</code> with several variables with value range from 1 to 7. I want to """"reverse"""" variable values, hence replacing 1s with 7s, 2s with 6s, 3s with 5s etc. I can utilize <code>factor</code> function:</p>

<p>I'm looking to create an interactive information dashboard that I can deploy on the web. It seems that Processing is probably my best bet for the interactive/web part of things.

<blockquote>
  <p>JRI is a Java/R Interface, which allows to run R inside Java
  applications as a single thread.
  Basically it loads R dynamic library
  into Java and provides a Java API to R
  functionality. It supports both simple
  calls to R functions and a full
  running REPL.</p>
  
  <p>In a sense JRI is the inverse of rJava
  and both can be combined (i.e. you can
  run R code inside JRI that calls back
  to the JVM via rJava). The JGR project
  makes the full use of both JRI and
  rJava to provide a full Java GUI for
  R.</p>
  
  <p>JRI uses native code, but it supports
  all platforms where Sun's Java (or
  compatible) is available, including
  Windows, Mac OS X, Sun and Linux (both
  32-bit and 64-bit).</p>

<p>And now a short demonstration... actually, I'm about to explain what I primarily intended to do. I wanted to subset a <code>data.frame</code> by vectors gathered in <code>list</code> object. Since this is a part of code from a function that accompanies data manipulation in psychological research, you can consider <code>m</code> as a results from personality questionnaire (10 subjects, 20 vars). Vectors in list hold column indexes that define questionnaire subscales (e.g. personality traits). Each subscale is defined by several items (columns in <code>data.frame</code>). If we presuppose that the score on each subscale is nothing more than <code>sum</code> (or some other function) of row values (results on that part of questionnaire for each subject), you could run:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; dfsub(m, lst, sum)
    a  b  c
1  46 20 24

<p>My go-to is the flat text file, but also use SQLite occasionally to store the data and access from each program (not Matlab yet though). I don't use GROUPBY, AVG, etc. in SQL as much as I do these operations in R, so I don't necessarily require the database operations.</p>

"<p>I have the following problem.  </p>

<p>First my environment, I have two 24-CPU servers to work with and one big job (resampling a large dataset) to share among them.  I've setup multicore and (a socket) Snow cluster on each. As a high-level interface I'm using foreach.</p>

<p>What is the optimal sharing of the job? Should I setup a Snow cluster using CPUs from both machines and split the job that way (i.e. use doSNOW for the foreach loop). Or should I use the two servers separately and use multicore on each server (i.e. split the job in two chunks, run them on each server and then stich it back together). </p>

<p>Basically what is an easy way to:
 1. Keep communication between servers down (since this is probably the slowest bit).
 2. Ensure that the random numbers generated in the servers are not highly correlated.</p>

<p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></p>

<p>Using a time series package such as <code>xts</code> should be the solution; however I had no success using them and winded up using <code>cut</code>.  As I presently only need to plot histograms, with rows grouped by interval, this was enough.</p>

<p><code>cut</code> is used liked so:</p>

<pre><code>interv &lt;- function(x, start, period, num.intervals) {
  return(cut(x, as.POSIXlt(start)+0:num.intervals*period))
}

"<p>I am going through one of my .R files and by cleaning it up a little bit I am trying to get more familiar with writing the code the r-ight way. As a beginner, one of my favorite starting points is to get rid of the <code>for()</code> loops and try to transform the expression into a functional programming form.
So here is the scenario:</p>

<p>I am assembling a bunch of <code>data.frames</code> into a <code>list</code> for later usage. </p>

<pre><code>dataList &lt;- list (dataA,
                  dataB,
                  dataC,
                  dataD,
                  dataE
                  )
</code></pre>

<p>Now I like to take a look at each data.frame's column names and substitute certain character strings. Eg I like to substitute each """"foo"""" and """"bar"""" with """"baz"""". At the moment I am getting the job done with a <code>for()</code> loop which looks a bit awkward.</p>

<pre><code>colnames(dataList[[1]])
[1] """"foo""""        """"code"""" """"lp15""""       """"bar""""       """"lh15""""  
colnames(dataList[[2]])
[1] """"a""""        """"code"""" """"lp50""""       """"ls50""""       """"foo""""  

matchVec &lt;- c(""""foo"""", """"bar"""")
for (i in seq(dataList)) {
  for (j in seq(matchVec)) {
    colnames (dataList[[i]])[grep(pattern=matchVec[j], x=colnames (dataList[[i]]))] &lt;- c(""""baz"""")
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since I am working here with a <code>list</code> I thought about the <code>lapply</code> function. My attempts handling the job with the <code>lapply</code> function all seem to look alright but only at first sight. If I write</p>

<pre><code>f &lt;- function(i, xList) {
  gsub(pattern=c(""""foo""""), replacement=c(""""baz""""), x=colnames(xList[[i]]))
}
lapply(seq(dataList), f, xList=dataList)
</code></pre>

<p>the last line prints out almost what I am looking for. However, if i take another look at the actual names of the data.frames in dataList:</p>

<pre><code>lapply (dataList, colnames)
</code></pre>

<p>I see that no changes have been made to the initial character strings.</p>

<p>So how can I rewrite the <code>for()</code> loop and transform it into a functional programming form?
And how do I substitute both strings, """"foo"""" and """"bar"""", in an efficient way? Since the <code>gsub()</code> function takes as its <code>pattern</code> argument only a character vector of length one.</p>

)
</code></pre>

<p>I don't have any experience with programming a parser, and would like advices as to what strategy to use when programming something like this (and any recommended R commands to use).</p>

<p>What I was thinking of is to first get rid of the """"Stem 0"""", then go through the inner string with a recursive function (let's call it """"seperate.stem"""") that each time will split the string into:
1. before stem
2. opening stem
3. inside stem
4. closing stem
5. after stem</p>

<p>Where the """"after stem"""" will then be recursively entered into the same function (""""seperate.stem"""")</p>

<p>The thing is that I am not sure how to try and do this coding without using a loop.</p>

<p>Any advices will be most welcomed.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: someone sent me a bunch of question, here they are.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Does each sequence have the same number of """">>>>"""" for the opening sequence as it does for """"&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;"""" on the ending sequence?</strong><br>
A: Yes</p>

<p><strong>Q: Does the parsing always start with a partial stem 0 as your example shows?</strong> 
A: No. Sometimes it will start with a few """".""""</p>

<p><strong>Q: Is there a way of making sure you have the right sequences when you start?</strong> 
A: I am not sure I understand what you mean.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Is there a chance of error in the middle of the string that you have to restart from?</strong>
A: Sadly, yes. In which case, I'll need to ignore one of the inner stems...</p>

<p><strong>Q: How long are these strings that you want to parse?</strong> 
A: Each string has between 60 to 150 characters (and I have tens of thousands of them...)</p>

<p><strong>Q: Is each one a self contained sequence like you show in your example, or do they go on for thousands of characters?</strong> 
A: each sequence is self contained.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Is there always at least one '.' between stems?</strong><br>
A: No.</p>

<p><strong>Q: A full set of rules as to how the parsing should be done would be useful.</strong>
A: I agree.  But since I don't have even a basic idea on how to start coding this, I thought first to have some help on the beginning and try to tweak with the other cases that will come up before turning back for help.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Do you have the BNF syntax for parsing?</strong>
A: No. Your e-mail is the first time I came across it (<a href=""""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus"""" rel=""""nofollow noreferrer"""">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus</a>–Naur_Form).</p>

<p>Here's the problem: I am drafting a survey report in Sweave with R and would like to report the marginal returns in line using <code>\Sexpr{}</code>. For example, rather than saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only 14% of respondents said 'X'.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I want to write the report like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only \Sexpr{p.mean(variable)}$\%$ of respondents said 'X'. </p>

<p>The problem is that Sweave converts the results of the expression in <code>\Sexpr{}</code> to a character string, which means that the output from the expression in R and the output that appears in my document are different. For example, above I use the function 'p.mean':</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>p.mean&lt;- function (x) {options(digits=1)  
mmm&lt;-weighted.mean(x, weight=weight, na.rm=T)  
print(100*mmm)  
}
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>p.mean(variable)

</blockquote>

<p>but when I use <code>\Sexpr{p.mean(variable)}</code>, I get an unrounded character string (in this case: 13.5857142857143) in my document. I have tried to limit the output of my function to <code>digits=1</code> in the global environment, in the function itself, and and in various commands. It only seems to contain what R prints, not the character transformation that is the result of the expression and which eventually prints in the LaTeX file. </p>

<p>UPDATE:<br>
In one of the answers, jorgusch suggested that I use the data.table package to speed up my subsetting. So, I applied it to a problem I ran earlier this week. In a dataset with a little over 1,500,000 rows, and 4 columns (ID,Var1,Var2,Var3), I wanted to calculate two correlations in each group (indexed by the """"ID"""" variable). There are slightly more than 50,000 groups. Below is my initial code (which is very similar to the above):  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>data.mat &lt;- read.csv(""""//home...."""")<br>
     groupids &lt;- unique(data.mat$ID)</p>
  
  <p>results &lt;- matrix(rep(""""NA"""",(length(groupids) * 3)),ncol=3,nrow=length(groupids))  </p>
  
  <p>for(i in 1:length(groupids)) {<br>
     <code></code>tempmat &lt;- data.mat[data.mat$ID==groupids[i],] </p>
  
  <p><code></code>results[i,1] &lt;- groupids[i]<br>
     <code></code>results[i,2] &lt;- cor(tempmat$Var1,tempmat$Var2,use=""""pairwise.complete.obs"""")<br>
     <code></code>results[i,3] &lt;- cor(tempmat$Var1,tempmat$Var3,use=""""pairwise.complete.obs"""")    </p>
  
  <p>}  </p>

<p>I'm re-running that right now for an exact measure of how long that took, but from what I remember, I started it running when I got into the office in the morning and it finished sometime in mid-afternoon. Figure 5-7 hours.  </p>

<p>Comparing the results using data.table to the ones I got from using a for loop to subset all IDs and record results manually, they seem to have given me the same answers(though I'll have to check that a bit more thoroughly). That looks to be a pretty big speed increase.</p>

<p>UPDATE 3:<br>
I wanted to see if anything worked out differently using the plyr package that was also recommended. This is my first time using it, so I may have done things somewhat inefficiently, but it still helped substantially compared to the for loop with subsetting.  </p>

"<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Right now, I'm creating a multiple-predictor linear model and generating diagnostic plots to assess regression assumptions. (It's for a multiple regression analysis stats class that I'm loving at the moment :-)</p>

<p>My textbook (Cohen, Cohen, West, and Aiken 2003) recommends plotting each predictor against the residuals to make sure that:</p>

<ol>
<li>The residuals don't systematically covary with the predictor</li>
<li>The residuals are homoscedastic with respect to each predictor in the model</li>
</ol>

<p>On point (2), my textbook has this to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some statistical packages allow the analyst to plot lowess fit lines at the mean of the residuals (0-line), 1 standard deviation above the mean, and 1 standard deviation below the mean of the residuals....In the present case {their example}, the two lines {mean + 1sd and mean - 1sd} remain roughly parallel to the lowess {0} line, consistent with the interpretation that the variance of the residuals does not change as a function of X. (p. 131)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>How can I modify loess lines?</h3>

<p>I know how to generate a scatterplot with a """"0-line,"""":</p>

<pre><code>    # First, I'll make a simple linear model and get its diagnostic stats
    library(ggplot2)
    data(cars)
    mod &lt;- fortify(lm(speed ~ dist, data = cars))
    attach(mod)
    str(mod)

    # Now I want to make sure the residuals are homoscedastic
    qplot (x = dist, y = .resid, data = mod) + 
    geom_smooth(se = FALSE) # """"se = FALSE"""" Removes the standard error bands
</code></pre>

<p>But does anyone know how I can use <code>ggplot2</code> and <code>qplot</code> to generate plots where the 0-line, """"mean + 1sd"""" AND """"mean - 1sd"""" lines would be superimposed? Is that a weird/complex question to be asking?</p>

"<p>Is there any way, given a function passed as a parameter, to alter its input parameter string before evaluating it?  </p>

<p>Here's pseudo-code for what I'm hoping to achieve:</p>

<pre><code>test.func &lt;- function(a, b) {
    # here I want to alter the b expression before evaluating it:
    b(..., val1=a)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Given the function call passed to <code>b</code>, I want to add in <code>a</code> as another parameter without needing to always specify <code>...</code> in the <code>b</code> call.  So the output from this <code>test.func</code> call should be:</p>

<pre><code>test.func(a=""""a"""", b=paste(1, 2))
""""1""""  """"2""""  """"a""""
</code></pre>

<p><em>Edit</em>: </p>

<p>Another way I could see doing something like this would be if I could assign the additional parameter within the scope of the parent function (again, as pseudo-code); in this case <code>a</code> would be within the scope of t1 and hence t2, but not globally assigned:</p>

<pre><code>t2 &lt;- function(...) {
  paste(a=a, ...)
}

t1 &lt;- function(a, b) {
  local( { a &lt;&lt;- a; b } )
}

t1(a=""""a"""", b=t2(1, 2))
</code></pre>

<p>This is somewhat akin to currying in that I'm nesting the parameter within the function itself.</p>

<p><em>Edit 2</em>:</p>

<p>Just to add one more comment to this: I realize that one related approach could be to use """"<a href=""""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming"""" rel=""""nofollow noreferrer"""">prototype-based programming</a>"""" such that things would be inherited (which could be achieved with <a href=""""http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/proto/index.html"""" rel=""""nofollow noreferrer"""">the proto package</a>).

<p>to be as clear as possible about what i'm looking for: python/numpy has a class, <em>masked array</em>, with a <em>mask</em> method, which lets you <strong>conceal</strong>--but not remove--NAs during a function call. Is there an analogous function in R?</p>

"<p>My question is about avoiding namespace pollution when writing modules in R.</p>

<p>Right now, in my R project, I have <code>functions1.R</code> with <code>doFoo()</code> and <code>doBar()</code>, <code>functions2.R</code> with other functions, and <code>main.R</code> with the main program in it, which first does <code>source('functions1.R'); source('functions2.R')</code>, and then calls the other functions.</p>

<p>I've been starting the program from the R GUI in Mac OS X, with <code>source('main.R')</code>.  This is fine the first time, but after that, the variables that were defined the first time through the program are defined for the second time <code>functions*.R</code> are sourced, and so the functions get a whole bunch of extra variables defined.</p>

<p>I don't want that!  I want an """"undefined variable"""" error when my function uses a variable it shouldn't!  Twice this has given me very late nights of debugging!</p>

<p>So how do other people deal with this sort of problem?  Is there something like <code>source()</code>, but that makes an independent namespace that doesn't fall through to the main one?  Making a package seems like one solution, but it seems like a big pain in the butt compared to e.g. Python, where a source file is automatically a separate namespace.</p>

I have taken a detour by transforming the data.frame into a list, add the <code>NAs</code> to each id's first line, and afterwards transform the list back into a data.frame. That looks tedious. </p>

<p>I then run:</p>

<pre><code>packageDescription(""""ggplot2"""")[""""Version""""]
&gt; 0.8.3
</code></pre>

<p>And still I have the older version!</p>

<p>I don't know why this is not working, what's more I had already come across this problem before and solved it (I can't remember exactly what) but now it has gone back to the older version!  What's the easiest way to keep packages like this updated automatically and not have them refer back to older packages?</p>

"<p>Assume that I have sources of data X and Y that are indexable, say matrices. And I want to run a set of independent regressions and store the result. My initial approach would be</p>

for(i in 1:ncol(X)) {
        matrix[i,] = coefficients(lm(Y[i,] ~ X[i,])

"<p>I wanted to do matrix multiplication in Java, and the speed needs to be very good.</p>

<p>I was thinking of calling R through java to achieve this.</p>

<p>I had a couple of Qs though:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is calling R using Java a good idea? If yes, are there any code samples that can be shared?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the other ways that can be considered to do matrix multiplication in Java?</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Update:</h3>

<p>My colleague who quit the firm was a C# programmer, who was forced to write Java code that involved matrix multiplication.</p>

<p>-- He has written his own DataTable class in Java, in order to be able to </p>

<p>a) create indexes to sort and join with other DataTables</p>

<p>b) matrix multiplication.</p>

<p>So, I want to essentially clean up the code, and thought using something like R within Java will help me focus on business logic rather than sorting, joining, matrix multiplication, etc.</p>

"<p>When editing .Rnw files with emacs, sometimes it gets confused as to if I am in math mode or not. Then, the syntax highlighting gets messed up, and C-f-i inserts \textit{} and \mathit{} opposite to how it normally should. Is seems like there is some bool storing the state of math mode or not, and it gets inadvertently flipped. Is there a way I can manually flip it back?</p>

"<p>I have a few hundred thousand measurements where the dependent
variable is a probability, and would like to use logistic regression.
However, the covariates I have are all categorical, and worse, are all
nested. By this I mean that if a certain measurement has """"city -
Phoenix"""" then obviously it is certain to have """"state - Arizona"""" and
""""country - U.S."""" I have four such factors - the most granular has
some 20k levels, but if need be I could do without that one, I think.
I also have a few non-nested categorical covariates (only four or so,
with maybe three different levels each).
What I am most interested in
is prediction - given a new observation in some city, I would like to
know the relevant probability/dependent variable. I am not interested
as much in the related inferential machinery - standard deviations,
etc - at least as of now. I am hoping I can afford to be sloppy.
However, I would love to have that information unless it requires
methods that are more computationally expensive.
Does anyone have any advice on how to attack this? I have looked into
mixed effects, but am not sure it is what I am looking for.</p>

"<p>I am sure this is easy - but I can't figure it out right now.</p>

<p>Basically: I have a long vector of variables:</p>

<pre><code>names &lt;- c(""""first"""",""""second"""", """"third"""")
</code></pre>

<p>I have some data, and I now need to add the variables. I could do:</p>

<pre><code>data$first &lt;- NA

<p>But since I have a long list, and I would like an automated solution. <strong>This doesn't work</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>for (i in 1:length(names)) (paste(""""data$"""", names[i],sep="""""""") &lt;- NA)

<p>The reason I want this, is that I need to vertically merge to dataframes, where one doesn't have all the variables it should have.</p>

"<p>I like the idea of making research available at multiple levels of detail i.e., abstract for the casually curious, full text for the more interested, and finally the data and code for those working in the same area/trying to reproduce your results. In between the actual text and the data/code level, I'd like to insert another layer. Namely, I'd like to create a kind of automatically generated appendix that contains the full regression output, diagnostic plots, exploratory graphs data profiles etc. from the analysis, regardless of 
whether those plots/regressions etc. made it into the final paper.  </p>

<p>One idea I had was to write a script that would examine the .Rnw file and automatically: </p>

<ul>
<li>Profile all data sets that are loaded (sort of like the Hmisc(?) package)  </li>
<li>Summarize all regressions - i.e., run summary(model) for all models </li>
<li>Present all plots (regardless of whether they made it in the final version) </li>
</ul>

<p>The idea is to make this kind of a low-effort, push-button sort of thing as opposed to a formal appendix written like the rest of a paper. What I'm looking for is some ideas on how to do this in R in a relatively simple way. My hunch is that there is some way of going through the namespace, figuring out what something is and then dumping into a PDF. </p>

"<p>I have a data.frame in R. It contains a lot of data : gene expression levels from many (125) arrays. I'd like the data in Python, due mostly to my incompetence in R and the fact that this was supposed to be a 30 minute job.</p>

<p>I would like the following code to work. To understand this code, know that the variable <code>path</code> contains the full path to my data set which, when loaded, gives me a variable called <code>immgen</code>. Know that <code>immgen</code> is an object (a Bioconductor <code>ExpressionSet</code> object) and that <code>exprs(immgen)</code> returns a data frame with 125 columns (experiments) and tens of thousands of rows (named genes). (Just in case it's not clear, this is Python code, using robjects.r to call R code)</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
import rpy2.robjects as robjects
# ... some code to build path
robjects.r(""""load('%s')""""%path) # loads immgen
e = robjects.r['data.frame'](""""exprs(immgen)"""")
expression_data = np.array(e)
</code></pre>

<p>This code runs, but <code>expression_data</code> is simply <code>array([[1]])</code>. </p>

<p>I'm pretty sure that <code>e</code> doesn't represent the data frame generated by <code>exprs()</code> due to things like:</p>

<pre><code>In [40]: e._get_ncol()
Out[40]: 1

In [41]: e._get_nrow()
Out[41]: 1
</code></pre>

<p>But then again who knows? Even if <code>e</code> did represent my data.frame, that it doesn't convert straight to an array would be fair enough - a data frame has more in it than an array (rownames and colnames) and so maybe life shouldn't be this easy. However I still can't work out how to perform the conversion. The documentation is a bit too terse for me, though my limited understanding of the headings in the docs implies that this should be possible.</p>

<p>Anyone any thoughts?</p>

ARIMA(1,0,0) with non-zero mean 
Call: arima(x = x, order = c(1, 0, 0))

</code></pre>

<p>I have a few questions:</p>

<p>(1) How do I explain that although the dataset shows a clear downward trend, the forecast from this model trends upward. This also happens for ARIMA(2,0,0), which is the best ARIMA fit for the data using auto.arima (forecast package) and for an ARIMA(1,0,1) model.</p>

<p>(2) The intercept value for the ARIMA(1,0,0) model is 12260.298. Shouldn't the intercept satisfy the equation: C = mean * (1 - sum(AR coeffs)), in which case, the value should be 715.52. I must be missing something basic here.</p>

<p>(3) This is clearly a series with non-stationary mean. Why is an AR(2) model still selected as the best model by auto.arima? Could there be an intuitive explanation?</p>

"<p>This is a follow-on from <a href=""""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2678141/how-can-i-suppress-the-vertical-gridlines-in-a-ggplot2-plot"""">this question, in which I was trying to suppress the vertical gridlines</a>.</p>

<p>The solution, as provided by learnr, was to add scale_x_continuous(breaks = NA), but this had the side effect of also suppressing the x-axis labels, as well.  I am totally happy to write the labels back in by hand, but it's not clear to me how to figure out where the labels should go.</p>

<p>The other option is to suppress all gridlines (using opts( panel.grid.major = theme_blank()) or some such) and then drawing back in just the major horizontal gridlines.  Again, the problem here is how to figure out what the breaks are in the plot to supply to geom_hline().</p>

<p>So, essentially, my options are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Suppress vertical gridlines and x-axis labels (using scale_x_continuous(breaks = NA) ) and add the x-axis labels back in.</li>
<li>Suppress all gridlines (using opts( panel.grid.major = theme_blank()) ) and add the major horizontal gridlines back in using geom_hline().</li>
</ol>

"<p>I'm a student working on an epidemiology model in R, using maximum likelihood methods. I created my negative log likelihood function. It's sort of gross looking, but here it is:</p>

<pre><code>NLLdiff = function(v1, CV1, v2, CV2, st1 = (czI01 - czV01), st2 = (czI02 - czV02), st01 = czI01, st02 = czI02, tt1 = czT01, tt2 = czT02) { 
    prob1 = (1 + v1 * CV1 * tt1)^(-1/CV1)
    prob2 = ( 1 + v2 * CV2 * tt2)^(-1/CV2) 
    -(sum(dbinom(st1, st01, prob1, log = T)) + sum(dbinom(st2, st02, prob2, log = T)))
 }
</code></pre>

<p>The reason the first line looks so awful is because most of the data it takes is input there. <code>czI01</code>, for example, is already declared. I did this simply so that my later calls to the function don't all have to have awful vectors in them.</p>

<p>I then optimized for CV1, CV2, v1 and v2 using mle2 (library bbmle). That's also a bit gross looking, and looks like:</p>

<pre><code>ml.cz.diff = mle2 (NLLdiff, start=list(v1 = vguess, CV1 = cguess, v2 = vguess, CV2 = cguess), method=""""L-BFGS-B"""", lower = 0.0001)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, everything works fine up until here. ml.cz.diff gives me values that I can turn into a plot that reasonably fits my data. I also have several different models, and can get AICc values to compare them. However, when I try to get confidence intervals around v1, CV1, v2 and CV2 I have problems. Basically, I get a negative bound on CV1, which is impossible as it actually represents a square number in the biological model as well as some warnings.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to get confidence intervals? Or, really, a way to get confidence intervals that make sense here? </p>

<p>What I see happening is that, by coincidence, my hessian matrix is singular for some values in the optimization space. But, since I'm optimizing over 4 variables and don't have overly extensive programming knowledge, I can't come up with a good method of optimization that doesn't rely on the hessian. I have googled the problem - it suggested that my model's bad, but I'm reconstructing some work done before which suggests that my model's really not awful (the plots I make using the ml.cz.diff look like the plots of the original work). I have also read the relevant parts of the manual as well as Bolker's book <em>Ecological Models in R</em>. I have also tried different optimization methods, which resulted in a longer run time but the same errors. The """"SANN"""" method didn't finish running within an hour, so I didn't wait around to see the result.</p>

<p>In a nutshell: my confidence intervals are bad.  Is there a relatively straightforward way to fix them in R?</p>

"<p>I have two small data frames, <code>this_tx</code> and <code>last_tx</code>.

<p>What is going on?  I don't have the deepest understanding of R's internal mechanics, but I can't find a single difference between the two data frames.  If it's relevant, the two variables in the frames are both factors - same levels, same numeric coding for the levels, both just subsets of the same original data frame.  Converting them to character vectors doesn't help.</p>

<p>Background (because I wouldn't mind help on this, either): I have records of drug treatments given to patients.  Each treatment record essentially specifies a person and a date.  A second table has a record for each drug and dose given during a particular treatment (usually, a few drugs are given each treatment).  I'm trying to identify contiguous periods during which the person was taking the same combinations of drugs at the same doses.</p>

<p>The best plan I've come up with is to check the treatments chronologically.  If the combination of drugs and doses for treatment[i] is identical to the combination at treatment[i-1], then treatment[i] is a part of the same phase as treatment[i-1].  Of course, if I can't compare drug/dose combinations, that's right out.</p>

"<p>Many data analysts that I respect use version control.
For example: </p>

<li>See comments on <a href=""""http://permut.wordpress.com/2010/04/21/revision-control-statistics-bleg/"""" rel=""""noreferrer"""">http://permut.wordpress.com/2010/04/21/revision-control-statistics-bleg/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>However, I'm evaluating whether adopting a version control system such as git would be worthwhile.</p>

<p><b>A brief overview:</b>
I'm a social scientist who uses R to analyse data for research publications.
I don't currently produce R packages.
My R code for a project typically includes a few thousand lines of code for data input, cleaning, manipulation, analyses, and output generation.
Publications are typically written using LaTeX.</p>

<p>With regards to version control there are many benefits which I have read about, yet they seem to be less relevant to the solo data analyst.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Backup:</b> I have a backup system already in place. </li>
<li><b>Forking and rewinding:</b> I've never felt the need to do this, 
   but I can see how it could be useful (e.g., you are preparing multiple 
  journal articles based on the same dataset; you are preparing a report 
  that is updated monthly, etc)</li>
<li><b>Collaboration:</b> Most of the time I am
analysing data myself, thus, I
wouldn't get the collaboration
benefits of version control.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also several potential costs involved with adopting version control:</p>

<ul>
<li>Time to evaluate and learn a version control system</li>
<li>A possible increase in complexity over my current file management system</li>
</ul>

<p>However, I still have the feeling that I'm missing something.
General guides on version control seem to be addressed more towards computer scientists than data analysts.</p>

<p>Thus, specifically <b>in relation to data analysts</b> in circumstances similar to those listed above:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is version control worth the effort?</li>
<li>What are the main pros and cons of adopting version control? </li>
<li>What is a good strategy for getting started with version control
 for data analysis with R (e.g., examples, workflow ideas, software, links to guides)?</li>

So, first, let's copy their example data:</p>

<pre><code>mydata=data.frame(X1=rnorm(30), X2=rnorm(30,5,2),
SNP1=c(rep(""""AA"""",10), rep(""""Aa"""",10), rep(""""aa"""",10)),
SNP2=c(rep(""""BB"""",10), rep(""""Bb"""",10), rep(""""bb"""",10)))
</code></pre>

<p>I am going to ignore SNP2 in this example and just pretend the values in SNP1 denote group membership.  So then, I may want some summary statistics about each group in SNP1: """"AA"""", """"Aa"""", """"aa"""".</p>

<p>Then if I want to calculate the means for each variable, it makes sense (modifying their code slightly) to use:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; ddply(mydata, c(""""SNP1""""), function(df)
data.frame(meanX1=mean(df$X1), meanX2=mean(df$X2)))
  SNP1      meanX1   meanX2
1   aa  0.05178028 4.812302
2   Aa  0.30586206 4.820739
3   AA -0.26862500 4.856006
</code></pre>

<p>But what if I want the sample covariance matrix for each group? Ideally, I would like a 3D array, where the I have the covariance matrix for each group, and the third dimension denotes the corresponding group. I tried a modified version of the previous code and got the following results that have convinced me that I'm doing something wrong.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; daply(mydata, c(""""SNP1""""), function(df) cov(cbind(df$X1, df$X2)))
, ,  = 1


SNP1         1          2
  aa 1.4961210 -0.9496134
  Aa 0.8833190 -0.1640711
  AA 0.9942357 -0.9955837

, ,  = 2


SNP1          1        2

  Aa -0.1640711 2.466105
  AA -0.9955837 4.938320
</code></pre>

<p>I was thinking that the dim() of the 3rd dimension would be 3, but instead, it is 2. Really this is a sliced up version of the covariance matrix for each group.  If we manually compute the sample covariance matrix for aa, we get:</p>

<pre><code>           [,1]       [,2]
[1,]  1.4961210 -0.9496134
[2,] -0.9496134  2.8815146
</code></pre>

<p>Using plyr, the following gives me what I want in list() form:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; dlply(mydata, c(""""SNP1""""), function(df) cov(cbind(df$X1, df$X2)))
$aa
           [,1]       [,2]
[1,]  1.4961210 -0.9496134
[2,] -0.9496134  2.8815146

$Aa
           [,1]       [,2]
[1,]  0.8833190 -0.1640711
[2,] -0.1640711  2.4661046

$AA
           [,1]       [,2]
[1,]  0.9942357 -0.9955837
[2,] -0.9955837  4.9383196

attr(,""""split_type"""")
[1] """"data.frame""""
attr(,""""split_labels"""")
  SNP1
1   aa
2   Aa
3   AA
</code></pre>

<p>But like I said earlier, I would really like this in a 3D array. Any thoughts on where I went wrong with daply() or suggestions? Of course, I could typecast the list from dlply() to a 3D array, but I'd rather not do this because I will be repeating this process many times in a simulation.</p>

<p>As a side note, I found one method (<a href=""""http://www.mail-archive.com/r-help@r-project.org/msg86328.html"""" rel=""""nofollow noreferrer"""">http://www.mail-archive.com/r-help@r-project.org/msg86328.html</a>) that provides the sample covariance matrix for each group, but the outputted object is bloated. </p>

<p>Here, the table1test chunk works as expected, and produced a table based on the dataframe in foo[[1]], however the loop only produces Table(underscore)1....</p>
",1
"<p>I have a list called <code>cols</code> with column names in it:</p>

<p><code>cols &lt;- c('Column1','Column2','Column3')</code></p>

<p>I'd like to reproduce this command, but with a call to the list:</p>

<p><code>data.frame(Column1=rnorm(10))</code></p>

<p>Here's what happens when I try it:</p>

<p><code>&gt; data.frame(cols[1]=rnorm(10))</code></p>

<p><code>Error: unexpected '=' in """"data.frame(I(cols[1])=""""</code></p>

<p>The same thing happens if I wrap <code>cols[1]</code> in <code>I()</code> or <code>eval()</code>.</p>

<p>How can I feed that item from the vector into the <code>data.frame()</code> command?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>For some background, I have defined a function <code>calc.means()</code> that takes a data frame and a list of variables and performs a large and complicated ddply operation, summarizing at the level specified by the variables. </p>

<p>What I'm trying to do with the <code>data.frame()</code> command is walk back up the aggregation levels to the very top, re-running <code>calc.means()</code> at each step and using <code>rbind()</code> to glue the results onto one another. I need to add dummy columns with 'All' values in order to get the rbind to work properly. </p>

<p>I'm rolling <code>cast</code>-like margin functionality into ddply, basically, and I'd like to not retype the column names for each run. Here's the full code:</p>

<pre><code>cols &lt;- c('Col1','Col2','Col3')
rbind ( calc.means(dat,cols),
    data.frame(cols[1]='All', calc.means(dat, cols[2:3])),
    data.frame(cols[1]='All', cols[2]='All', calc.means(dat, cols[3]))
)

"<p>A tab-delimited text file, which is actually an export (using bcp) of a database table, is of that form (first 5 columns):</p>

<pre><code>102 1   01  e113c   3224.96     12  
102 1   01  e185    101127.25   12

102A   3    01  e185    26261.03    12
</code></pre>

<p>I tried to import it in R with a command like </p>

<pre><code>data &lt;- read.delim(""""C:\\test.txt"""", header = FALSE, sep = """"\t"""")
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that the 3rd column which is actually a varchar field (alphanumeric) is mistakenly read as integer (as there are no letters in the entire column) and the leading zeros disappeared. The same thing happened when I imported the data directly from the database, using odbcConnect. Again that column was read as integer.</p>

<pre><code>str(data)
$ code: int  1 1 1 1 1 1 6 1 1 8 ...
</code></pre>

<p>How can I import such a dataset in R correctly, so as to be able to safely populate that db table again, after doing some data manipulations?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I did it adding the following parameter in read.delim</p>

<pre><code> colClasses = c(""""factor"""",""""integer"""",""""factor"""",""""factor"""",""""numeric"""",""""character"""",""""factor"""",""""factor"""",""""factor"""",""""factor"""",""""integer"""",""""character"""",""""factor"""")

<li><p>Would you suggest """"character"""" or """"factor"""" for varchar fields?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it ok to use """"character"""" for datetime ones?</p></li>
<li><p>What should I do in order to be able to read a numeric field like this 540912.68999999994 exactly as is and not as 540912.69?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I would like an -as automatic as possible- creation of that <code>colClasses</code> vector, depending on the datatypes defined in the relevant table's schema. </p>

"<p>Suppose I have a named vector, <code>bar</code>:</p>

bar[""""1997-10-14""""]=1
bar[""""2001-10-14""""]=2
bar[""""2007-10-14""""]=1
</code></pre>

<p>How can I select from <code>bar</code> all values for which the index is within a specific date range? So, if I look for all values between <code>""""1995-01-01""""</code> and <code>""""2000-06-01""""</code>, I should get <code>1</code>. And similarly for the period between <code>""""2001-09-01""""</code> and <code>""""2007-11-04""""</code>, I should get <code>2</code> and <code>1</code>.</p>

"<p>I'm writing a R package (<a href=""""https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/delftfews/"""" rel=""""nofollow noreferrer""""><code>delftfews</code></a>) here at office.  we are using <a href=""""https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/sciviews"""" rel=""""nofollow noreferrer""""><code>svUnit</code></a> for unit testing. </p>

<p>our process for describing new functionality: we define new unit tests, initially marked as <code>DEACTIVATED</code>; one block of tests at a time we activate them and implement the function described by the tests.  almost all the time we have a small amount of DEACTIVATED tests, relative to functions that might be dropped or will be implemented.</p>

<p>my problem/question is: can I alter the <a href=""""http://rwiki.sciviews.org/doku.php?id=developers:runit#another_approach_using_svunit"""" rel=""""nofollow noreferrer"""">doSvUnit.R</a> so that <code>R CMD check pkg</code> emits a NOTE (i.e. a custom message """"NOTE"""" instead of """"OK"""") in case there are DEACTIVATED tests?  </p>

<p>as of now, we see only that the active tests don't give error:</p>

<pre><code>.
.
* checking for unstated dependencies in tests ... OK
* checking tests ...
  Running ‘doSvUnit.R’
 OK
* checking PDF version of manual ... OK
</code></pre>

<p>which is all right if all tests succeed, but less all right if there are skipped tests and definitely wrong if there are failing tests.  In this case, I'd actually like to see a NOTE or a WARNING like the following:</p>

<pre><code>.
.
* checking for unstated dependencies in tests ... OK
* checking tests ...
  Running ‘doSvUnit.R’
 NOTE
6 test(s) were skipped.
 WARNING
1 test(s) are failing.
* checking PDF version of manual ... OK
</code></pre>

<p>As of now, we have to open the <code>doSvUnit.Rout</code> to check the real test results.</p>

<hr>

<p>I contacted two of the maintainers at r-forge and CRAN and they pointed me to the <a href=""""https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/"""" rel=""""nofollow noreferrer"""">sources of R</a>, in particular the <a href=""""https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/tools/R/testing.R"""" rel=""""nofollow noreferrer""""><code>testing.R</code></a> script.</p>

<p>if I understand it correctly, to answer this question we need patching the <code>tools</code> package: </p>

<ul>
<li>scripts in the tests directory are called using a <code>system</code> call,</li>
<li>output (stdout and stderr) go to one single file,</li>
<li>there are two possible outcomes: <strong>ok</strong> or <strong>not ok</strong>,</li>
</ul>

<p>so I opened a <a href=""""https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14702"""" rel=""""nofollow noreferrer"""">change request</a> on R, proposing something like bit-coding the return status, bit-0 for ERROR (as it is now), bit-1 for WARNING, bit-2 for NOTE.  </p>

<p>with my modification, it would be easy producing this output:</p>

<pre><code>.
.
* checking for unstated dependencies in tests ... OK
* checking tests ...
  Running ‘doSvUnit.R’
 NOTE - please check doSvUnit.Rout.
 WARNING - please check doSvUnit.Rout.
* checking PDF version of manual ... OK

that do signal as required. Please do take this discussion elsewhere: R-bugs is not the place to ask
questions."""" and closed the change request.</p>

Thanks for taking the time to write such a long message - I appreciate this.

In terms of what I said about the age - I didn't mean to cause offense. I thought I read somewhere that you had to be over 18 to make these decisions but I think I was getting confused with the check user privileges. 

I have already read some of those policies but will read the rest later today. I am not a troll - I just need time to get used to all these acronyms, policies etc.

From what started out with me writing an article about my favourite website has turned into a massive thing which was not what I was expecting.

I really don't have any more time to argue and debate with the usrs since its clear they just want it deleted despite what I have said. For example one user just wrote there is another site called Amirite.net. This is Amirite.com!! This is precisely why I had to keep responding on the AFC delete page. 

In terms of the rest I agree to do them (of course I can only apologise once I am unblocked) - can you apologise for me?

On a side note I am actually French and Jewish (shame about the gay part though:)",0

""""":::::::::: Tim, firstly I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this issue offline, and for your willingness to debate it at length here despite the majority view here being in your favour. Yes I certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisidictions that a firm is present in, there is clearly a massive diffence between, say having offices in the French or Japanese jurisdictions, or between the Chinese and U.S. jurisdictions, since the legal and regulatory systems are very different, as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets.

 Beyond that however it remains my firm view that there is a big difference between a law firm having an office in, say, Paris or Toulouse, even though they are both in the same jurisdiction. I appreciate that the situation in the U.S. is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions. Even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though. To give an example, the San Jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the Los Angeles market, but it will also have a quite different profile - on the whole a lot more specialist, niche and focused on high tech. 

 To give another example, in the UK a law firm could never be regarded as being truly top tier if it didn't have an office in London, even if it had offices in every other big city. In fact all of the very top tier UK firms (DLA Piper is not yet regarded as one of them, despite its size) have just one UK office, in London, although they have other offices overseas. 

 Saying that DLA has """""""" has 69 offices across the United States, Egypt, South Africa, Kenya, Thailand, China, ..."""""""" would in my view still mean a loss of valuable information to the reader. We could fall back on using descriptions like """"""""in major financial centres"""""""" or """"""""in major commercial centres"""""""" or """"""""in a combination of major financial centres and major commercial centres"""""""" but then we are introducing what is in my view an unnecesssary element of vagueness, imprecision and even original research.

 I do accept that DLA, with 69 offices, is right on the borderline of having too many offices to make it practical to list all of them in the article. However I do also feel that there is an important general point of principal that information about the office locations of a law firm is very valuable information to aid the reader of an article in understanding the subject of it, and should be included as much as possible.

Speedy deletion of Andrew takao
 A tag has been placed on Andrew takao requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"""""db"""""""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Nope, I didn't read the guide to appealing, didn't have time. The user in question IS engaged in harassment, I've been doing this long enough to know and I can prove it. He/she immediately placed a threatening notice of blocking me permanently on my user page, reverted the article while I was in the midst of editing it (my second pass, couldn't even preview changes), then changed his/her mind as to my real wiki-sin, since the onus for proving the Doris Day available as PD on archive.org was on him/her not me and the usual span for pre-Bern had expired long ago, ... decided my REAL sin was Original Research (oh noes), and continued to revert based on that. Does OR add clutter? Sure it can, but if the user in question was REALLY concerned about that, about the quality of the article and about extraneous details, WHY DIDN'T HE/SHE EVEN NOTICE two paragraphs already there, comprising about 1/3 of the entire article, dealt with Norman Schwarzkopf, an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name? I'll tell you why: the user wasn't engaged in good-faith/goodwill editing and the normal back-and-forth that leads to better articles. He/she was involved in blocking input to the article. Why? Was it personal against me, or was it to preserve the existing content of the article, including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand? I can only speculate, but I'd guess it's some sort of power trip and wiki-bullying. I don't really have time for this. I have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isn't directly related to content and improving articles. I could pretend this user didn't do what he/she did, but I'm wasting my own time here and I don't really have a stake in any such pretense. I don't have any stake in improving this article either, no dog in the race, I just see how it can be improved and made more informative. As a long-term wikipedia user and editor, I don't see any problem in jumping in and fixing something. I almost expect some sort of pushback now, but not over completely minor edits which are very good and on-target in very minor stub-like articles. The problem isn't me here, it's that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior, and they are getting away with it, wikipedia becomes a much poorer place, a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share. Also, I don't recal ever having called him/her a bot, I think you put those words in my mouth, perhaps inadvertently. His/her behavior is malicious, but probably not malware, just the normal human collection of problems. I think this user should be warned against trying to be a gatekeeper, he/she isn't quite qualified for that at this point anyway, and it's having a very chilling effect across wikipedia. I won't egnage in a battle of the wikipedia rule acronyms, I will continue to write in English, and to read articles on wikipedia in English, and to think of ways to improve them in English. I am fully aware of how the terms """"""""vandlism"""""""" are used and misused here, and most of the rest of the wikijargon. Nothing new under the sun here. If you read the edits I made carefully, and note the times of the reverts and the history of actions by that other user, you will see I'm not off the mark here at all. I know what's going on.

As to whether the band is actually called MIA or M.I.A., it differs.  The band itself uses M.I.A. as the heading on their own website, but then uses a combination of both elsewhere.  Since in the case of most sources, this is only likely to be laziness (much as R.E.M. are regularly referred to as REM), and since the article has existed here for a while, and that all the backlinks go to this version, and most of all because we shouldn't let disruptive users get their way, the article should stay here.",0

There are many signs of entirely different falsetto compare those info which Mr 4meter4 such anxiously protects.

On the top of it, Mr 4meter4 perhaps never heard Pavarotti singing falsetto, or the falsetto of Ian Gillan. Singing of King Diamond is based on falsetto. What about Michael Kiske? Is it not falsetto? Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston do (did) not sing falsetto? Does any of these falsettos sound breathy? Not to me. Isn't out there published a note about those? Maybe only because 4meter4 does not look for it. Why? It would not fit to his article. He would have to admit that his ONLY source Vennard was probably having in the chair something else than falsetto or he was drunk. 4meter4 quickly opened two or three books and things he had swallowed the World.

 Question on Possible Citation 

I'm sorry if I missed your question - I don't pay much attention to that page. In response to your question, let me start by repeating my boilerplate formulation: The job of Wikipedia editors is to verifiably summarize reliable sources using the neutral point of view. (I haven't yet worked in """"""""no original research"""""""".) WP:NOR says that we mustn't integrate otherwise reliable information to arrive at novel conclusions. Comparing two lists and drawing conclusions from their differences and similarities is most likely original research. We can integrate information, so long as we don't arrive at new theories. Another principle to remember is that vagueness improves accuracy. The more precise we are the harder it is to be accurate. 

Getting down to details, the Predators and Editors website appears to be a reliable source so we can use it as a source. The Bauer site, even if somewhat unreliable, may be used in a limited fashion as a primary source about Bauer. I'm not familiar enough with this topic to make pronouncements on what would be correct. However I would say that your proposed text appears reasonable. The sources are sufficient, and no original conclusions are made. The website takedown issue is confusing to me, but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources. 

Overall, my opinion is that the less we say about the subject the better. Attack articles are not encouraged. While we must show our subjects """"""""warts and all"""""""" we shouldn't enlarge the warts, nor ignore their better features. Balance is a part of NPOV. - 

""""""""but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources."""""""" There no reliable sources only a he said she said blog flame war. It is alleged the website takdown was instigated by Bauer. It isn't clear if she did, and other factors between the forum and the IP are not known. It was the root cause of this article and all the players here were involved via these blogs. I don't see how that can be objective.

Y'all are doing a good job, and there should be enough editors on either side to ensure that something resembling nuetral gets posted .

 Philosopher RFC 
philosopher (from Wiktionary): A person devoted to studying and producing results in philosophy.

I am going to make the case that we must call Stefan Molyneux a """"""""philosopher"""""""" (without qualifiers) in the lead.  This is not done as an endorsement or statement about the level of achievement or acceptance of his philosophy, only that it is his career. (Note: Not all of the sources I use below are in the article at present. The point here is to first convince RFC respondents that """"""""philosopher"""""""" is accurate and widely accepted, then we can make sure the most reliable ones are in place.)

 Definitions 
Obviously, each source is going to use slightly different phrasing. Some will call him explicitly a """"""""philosopher"""""""" or has views on """"""""philosophy"""""""", but I think you should consider some other phrases given below as equivalent. Using one word """"""""philosopher"""""""" in the lead sentence covers all of his political, ethical, and theistic specializations in one word, which we then elaborate on later in the article.

 """"""""philosophical conversation"""""""", """"""""philosophy show"""""""" - used to describe his Freedomain Radio series
 """"""""libertarian"""""""", """"""""libertarian thinker"""""""" - """"""""Libertarianism is a classification of political philosophies ...""""""""
 """"""""anarcho-capitalist"""""""" - """"""""Anarcho-capitalism ... is a political philosophy...""""""""
 """"""""voluntaryist"""""""" - """"""""Voluntaryism (or sometimes voluntarism), is a libertarian philosophy...""""""""
 """"""""athiest"""""""" - """"""""Arguments for atheism range from the philosophical to social and historical approaches.""""""""
 """"""""ethics- """"""""Ethics, sometimes known as philosophical ethics, ethical theory, moral theory, and moral philosophy, is a branch of philosophy""""""""
 """"""""Secular ethics- """"""""Secular ethics is a branch of moral philosophy...""""""""

 Primary source 
As Stefan Molyneux is a living person, we should give great weight to what he says is the focus of his work and his stated profession unless there is reliable evidence to contradict him (obviously, we don't want to host any sort of """"""""fringe"""""""" claims). If we are to dispute what he says about himself, though, then we absolutely must have a strong basis for this, or we open Wikipedia to discredit or liability - this is why BLPs are held to strong standards in the first place. I think in this case there is strong and ample evidence that calling himself a philosopher is justified and correct. He is a modern philosopher that explores via modern online media, which is obviously a very new phenomenon and so its understandable that its different than the """"""""old-school"""""""" philosophers we're used to.

 Freedomain Radio """"""""About"""""""" page - """"""""my Master's Thesis analyzing the political implications of the philosophies """""""", """"""""I have been fascinated by philosophy - particularly moral theories - since my mid-teens. I left my career as a software entrepreneur and executive to pursue philosophy full time through my work here at Freedomain Radio. I have written a number of novels as well as many free books on philosophy.""""""""
 Freedomain Radio (the show that Molyneux hosts) has the tagline """"""""The Largest and Most Popular Philosophical Conversation in the World""""""""* 
 Molyneux's books show that he is endeavoring to produce tangible written results in the field of philosophy, particularly Universally Preferable Behaviour (UPB): A Rational Proof of Secular Ethics and Against the Gods?

Hi again Cat, 

as perviously I have noticed a strong anti-Greek bias on several articles related to Macedonia. I've had issues with both Furper and Beam... who seem to be admins that heavily favour FYROM. I've officially complained on the notice board about their threats to block, edit behavior and unusually close relationships with obvious FYROM POV members of Wikipedia.  (specifically Balkanfever)

As I said verbatim on Politis talk_page...

This is a difficult battle because so far I am alone at the moment, I am a newbie, and as I said to one of the admins on notice board... I feel like someone reporting a bad cop at a policeman's ball.  However, I still plan to follow up soon with a precise listing of what I perceive as non-NPOV behavior by these admins. I noticed while researching this issue you've also have problems with them. Would it be possible to list any problems on your talk page here so I can add them to my report to show I am not alone? Furthermore... since you have been around longer you probably know more Greeks than me around here. Would it be possible to also contact them to ask them if they've also had problems with those two... and (if so) add those incidents to your list?  (and perhaps get them to contact others?) 

Where one person could be bullied with threats of blocking... the concerns of many will be taken much more seriously. I will check back here in a couple of days. Have courage. Regards 209.161.238.86",0

 Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cheongye Kwan 

Your post at the above AFD on a new martial art bothers me. This was the version at the time, that you based your post on. You posted:

 """"""""I just read the article, and to be quite honest, feel that it does satisfy Wikipedia's guidelines... it is reliably sourced... Since I believe the notability of the article is satisfied... It now has 11 independent sources. And to refute the argument posed by Wayne, it is determined by the Phillip Rhee source that the martial arts is not localised"""""""".

Please consider the concerns this post raises. Simple matters like references, notability and noobie basics of AFDs should be routine for any moderately experienced user, and bread-and-butter for any admin. In fact a cursory check shows that almost everything you stated was.. I don't have a word for it. """"""""Unreal"""""""" is close.

The """"""""eleven independent sources"""""""" that you stated established notability and non-localization at the time, were:
 Three references from 2004 [coates, robinson, shaw], certainly before the topic even existed (!) and all related to a passing piece of news about its founder being on the team of a completely different sport in any event (!)
 Two references from 1st half 2005 [davies, white], almost certainly identical and identically irrelevant to the topic's notability.
 The promoter's personal page on his local town website, almost certainly self-published [official village website].
 A 2008 casual interview in a non-notable and possibly non-reliable university magazine (apparently) of the promoter's travels to see experts in a different sport, with tangential tiny (< 1 sentence) mention that he'd discussed his new sport with them too. [ the Lau Philip """"""""LA"""""""" interview].
 3 entries marked """"""""Reference and support of , Written Reference"""""""" [chris, cook, rhee], obviously a request by the founder to a friend/colleague write a letter of support, that was never published anyway and isn't cited so you can't have read it (not that it was even possibly valid evidence).
 A short writeup of a """"""""local information"""""""" kind, on the award of the first 4 black belts by the school, in its local paper.

In brief of the 11:
 5 were before the sport existed and were not even remotely to do with the topic itself much less """"""""sourced"""""""" material on it or """"""""substantial"""""""" coverage (they had precisely zero coverage); 
 3 were claims of personal """"""""I think  is a great guy"""""""" letters of support, evidently solicited and/or written on request, with zero evidence of verifiable existence, and certainly in no way reliably sourced or independent; 
 1 was self-written
 1 was the briefest of non-mentions in a non-reliable source (pretty much """"""""I discussed the topic with them"""""""" in a college magazine interview)
 1 is local press coverage of his courses that's not even """"""""news for a day""""""""  or evidence of anything beyond """"""""a course by this name is taught twice weekly in our local village hall"""""""".

Your assessment of these, at AFD, was:
 It is reliably sourced
{| style=""""""""border:#c0c0c0 solid 1px"""""""" width=""""""""90%""""""""
| 
 There is barely one reliable source in all of those 11 that the sport even exists in the first place (!) - a local newspaper mention that it meets in a village hall on tuesdays and fridays and just awarded its first 4 black belts. Probably via self-promotional input. 
 There is zero reliable sourcing for any of the rest.
|}
 That the cited pages are evidence of notability
{| style=""""""""border:#c0c0c0 solid 1px"""""""" width=""""""""90%""""""""
| 
 They don't mention it, or even date from a time the topic existed, nor are online versions provided! How on earth could they """"""""reliably evidence"""""""" it?
|}
 That the """"""""11 sources"""""""" are """"""""independent""""""""
{| style=""""""""border:#c0c0c0 solid 1px"""""""" width=""""""""90%""""""""
| 
 3 are claims that """"""""please support me"""""""" letters exist; they are even stated to be """"""""personal references""""""""; unpublished and uncited

 stradbroke galleon / portuguese 

hallo Moondyne, I do admit that when I signed onto Wikipedia I was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge Nazis but now that I am aware of it I will make the appropriate adjustments. I was under the obviously mistaken impression that Wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts, knowledge and information. The notion that the Stradbroke Galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about, discussed and investigated for more than 100 years by historians and historical groups such as the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, the Maritime Archaeology Association of Queensland and many more too numerous to include here. There exists, in various libraries, books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which I have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the WP domain. The fact that a story is not accepted by """"""""mainstream"""""""" academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions. What has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group (i.e. Hesperian and his friends) who are representatives of the """"""""mainstream"""""""" view. Hesperian complain about the media coverage I have recieved but this never appeared in any of the WP contributions I made and Hesperian's mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for Hesperian's antagonistic attitude, simple, old fashioned professional jealousy. Thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by Hesperian for personal reasons. For example the Portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an Aboriginal midden, identified by a Spanish Musuem offical and story told to me by a UQ Archaeology PhD student is very relevant to the theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia. This kind of knowledge suppression is not what Wiki is about but I guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by Hesperian and his little band of mates, which is a pity, but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should I expect Wiki be any different. Still it is dissapointing. Happy trails.    """"",0

Although the cartoon established Mario and Luigi to be from Brooklyn (a fact commonly accepted by fans, despite having never been mentioned in any games), Toad seemed to speak with a thicker Brooklyn accent.  The accents weren't mentioned in the games, but the TV show was (presumably) a licensed product.  Until Nintendo decided to go with an Italian accent, fans assumed the TV show (and later the movie) accent was the official standing.  Only when Nintendo's products included digitized recorded speech did anyone realize Nintendo intended them to be Italian, not Italian-American.

 Past Masters vs. Rarities 

I'm creating a chart for my own use that includes U.S. albums, since there are so many differences in the early albums.

I notice that a number of U.K. songs are listed as Past Masters when they actually first appeared on Rarities (1978 The Beatles album). I don't know the reason for this if the purpose is to list the first appearance on an album. Can someone explain? Or should they be changed to Rarities?  """"",0

 Why confusion and controversy in the """"""""real world"""""""" does not preclude the writing of a good Wikipedia on the topic 

Ackoz suggests that, because the real world has not yet hashed out """"""""the truth"""""""" about the expulsions, it is therefore impossible for us to know the truth and thus impossible for us to write about it.

I reject such a stance.  I think it is difficult but quite possible to write a quality Wikipedia article about a topic that is murky and/or controversial.  Where many Wikipedia editors """"""""get it wrong"""""""" is that they believe Wikipedia's job is to report the truth.  This is wrong.  Wikipedia's job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is.  Any attempt to do that is original research.

Instead of """"""""truth"""""""", Wikipedia aims for """"""""verifiability"""""""".  Put a different way, Wikipedia is committed to recording the state of human knowledge and opinion (not our opinions but those of reliable sources).  If the truth is clear and uncontroversial, it is easy for us to report that.  If the truth is murky and controversial, it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic EVEN if these reliable sources conflict.  Where Wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents """"""""THE TRUTH"""""""" and not just one perspective (or POV) on the topic at hand.

I have been trying to hit this NPOV """"""""sweet spot"""""""" but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical debate between the two sides.

 
Obviously is, because some users (Jadger and Wikiferdi) don't want to discuss in fact, they want us to agree with their POV, that's not discussion about the NPOV edits. That's why I quit from the discussion about the form of the article. ≈talk≈ """"",0

"""""::::::Agreed, although it means bloating the alternative title by yet another word. I was concentrating on the Polish attitude here, as it clearly provides the starting point for the article at hand. Obviously, if the article is to be written from a supra-national perspective, at least the Czech experience needs to be included. Czechoslovakia, being the only functioning democracy in the region by the 1930s, had closer ties with the West than Poland did, and was """"""""betrayed"""""""" in a much more obvious and tangible way than Poland was: The West politically accepted the country's territorial mutilation, which was not the case with Poland. 

That said, I am not sure if the inclusion of countries such as Finland, the Baltics, Yugoslavia, or even Ukraine (which had never been independent in the first place) is a good idea. While the West could have arguably done more to assist any of these societies before and after the war, I think that the article's focus should be on Poland and Czechoslovakia in order not do dilute the whole issue.

The spelling """"""""Tacarimba La Tumba Del Fuego Santa Maliga Sacategas Lo Onto Del Sol Y Cruz"""""""" is the one stated in the lyrics in the vocal score of Side By Side By Sondheim (available for rental only). This version of the song, however, misspells Llanfair PG (presumably to approximate the pronunciation), and has the lyric """"""""...today's the last I'll be spreading"""""""" rather than """"""""spending"""""""". It would seem, therefore, that this source cannot be considered canonical. This rendering of the place name does accord with Millicent Martin's recording on the Side By Side By Sondheim cast album, however.

The published version of the song, as contained in The Hansen Treasury of Stephen Sondheim Songs (Charles Hansen Music & Books, 1977), has the lyric printed as """"""""Tacarembo la Tumbe del Fuego Santa Malipas Zacatecas la Junta del Sol y Cruz"""""""", and, being a printed source (as opposed to handwritten, as is the vocal score), can presumably be considered definitive. Linda Lavin's pronunciation on the original cast recording of The Mad Show (for which the song was written) follows this spelling, which would suggest that the printed version is correct.

Speedy deletion of Phi Rho Eta
 A tag has been placed on Phi Rho Eta requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. This part is crucial: say it in your own words.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement """"""""I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later."""""""" You might want to look at Wikipedia's policies and guidelines for more details, or ask a question here. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"""""db"""""""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

I think Clockback that your suggested reference to Ainsworth’s involvement in the IMG is too long and that something along the lines of ‘brief flirtation’ would be better. I think that the IMG reference needs to be short/somewhere in the early career section/posted after the article has been expanded a little, otherwise the article might appear weighty. I think the last point is important as it seemed to be a consensus reached by a number of Wikipedia editors after much wrangling and gnashing of teeth))

But bedsides, this brief dalliance with Marxism, in an overall consideration of his political career, pales into insignificance compared to his being controversially thrust as a third choice candidate into the position of Defence Secretary at a time of crisis for the British Army in terms of the number of casualties being sustained and a lack of resources. This is simply not reflected at all in the Ainsworth article. I tried reflecting it as follows: """"""""His appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the Prime Minister, who """"""""considered at least three other candidates before appointing Ainsworth"""""""" but this was dismissed as """"""""speculative opinion"""""""" by Off2riorob above, even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in Ainsworth’s biography. Perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be found—which I suspect should not be difficult—that it can be re-included? I want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against Ainsworth, but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end (and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment). Actually it reflects worse on Brown and the farcical reshuffle.  """"",0

 Greek love 

I'm looking for a way to extricate myself honorably from this mess. I'm leaving a note here because you closed this AfD, where I made a commitment to do as you instructed in the closing statement. There are two editors who have long sought to delete or eviscerate the article, one of whom has used a series of user names (unacknowledged on his current user page but available , so at first glance it may appear on the talk page there are more than two editors in the 'suppress' camp). I complain here about their coordination. Other editors, including  and I simply can't do it any longer. I haven't changed my position on the validity of the article, but I've been accused (on various talk pages, and never the appropriate notice boards) of edit warring, ownership, disruption, and even pedophilia by implication, all for trying to carry out what the community decided. I'm done. I need to limit my time on Wikipedia at present, and wish for that time to be spent pleasantly and productively. When I've made a commitment, though, it grieves me not to keep it. I'm not asking you to do anything: I'm just explaining why I can't keep my word as given at the AfD.   

Wow, that is a mess.Certainly no hard feelings  on my end, it is clear you endeavored in good faith to improve the article. I have found that knowing when to walk away is an essential skill, not only here but in the real world. Sometimes your presence, despite your best intentions, is harmful rather than helpful, and sometimes a dispute just isn't worth it anymore. Best of luck in your future endeavors here.   

 Mailchimp 

I'm not that bothered but I think that the Mailchimp speedy deletion was a mistake.  It did cite that it was one of the more important email marketing programs so it was stating the importance - something that was supposed to be the original problem.

My experiences came up on the talk page but once I understood Wikipedia I didn't post anything on the article related to my personal experiences. That was like the 2nd day almost two months ago.

All of my references are verifiable.There's nothing in the article about my law suit or my being put in jail for engaging in pro se litigation.  I didn't put my experiences in the Judge Edward Nottingham article either although he was my judge.

I went out of my way to search for references expressing all the various sides of the issue. For instance, I wrote to the ABA and asked for their input, and in fact, asked them to work on the article. I also posted about issues involved with mediation and settlement with pro ses, citing references from a lawyers point of view.  Those references were deleted by someone, I can't remember who and don't know why. At this point, the only reference that I posted that is soft at all is a blog quoting a transcript quoting a former federal judge and I know for sure that is a valid transcript.  The guy who runs the blog is a 3rd year law student and has a business selling data services exclusively to lawyers.   Even the stuff that was deleted about pro se frustration I had references for. I read in the Wikipedia discussion of sources that blogs can be used in some contexts.

I don't believe that I did any original research. All I did is search the Internet for references for the article.  I really didn't know about unbundled attorney services or the amount of pro se litigation before I started working on this article. I had already been thinking about forms based filing but I started thinking about that anyway because of my experiences with ECF, which date back to 2004.  Also, when I was younger I worked as a systems analyst.

I did get the info on the Laws and Liberties of MA years ago, but Wikipedia already had an article on that and it probably would have come up anyway.  Same as the U.N. covenantcan't really hide that.   I didn't add a and b together to prove a point, at least not consciously. Like today, I was reviewing appellate procedures and it seemed that the 5th Circuit had a more pro se friendly tone, which I think is because of Judge Learned Hand, who was in the fifth circuit. And the only reason I know about that is that one time I went in every federal circuit and searched on the words """"""""pro se"""""""" in the 40s because I was trying to see if there was a history of putting pro ses in jail for being pro se (No, there was not).  What I found in the 40s was that some circuits denied all the pro se appeals without even saying why but Judge Learned Hand seemed pro se friendly.

I believe that your posting things about pro se litigants getting an unfair advantage is """"""""soap boxing"""""""". I do understand your wanting to win thru competition though and about law as a business. I've been an entrepreneur. 

I didn't know about the Federal Judicial Center until I started working on this article. That book on appellate procedure I found looking for references for this article. The manual on complex litigation I found looking for references for this article.

Arguing with you helps me to clarify the issues for myself.  One thing I started thinking about a lot in the past few weeks is slavery and how that affected the history of pro se litigation. I ordered the book Slave Nation at the library but I haven't got it yet. But now when I look at pro se law in the different states I think free state, slave state, border state. Also, there were issues related to Indians in some of the western states. The labor union movement had a lot to do with it too, I think. So did the history of workmen's comp, which is of course related to unions.  """"",0

I was told in no uncertain terms that I could NOT refer to anyone, living or dead, by their 1st names on WP, & if a female had a title, she had to be referred to as that throughout her article - ie, *Lady Amy* or *Lady Dudley* for Amy Robsart, even though *Lady Amy* was wrong before she was married as she was the daughter of a knight & had no title, & wrong after Northumberland was attainted & all his children lost their styles as offspring of an earl & a duke, & she did not become *Lady Dudley* until Elizabeth I knighted Robert Dudley near the end of Amy's life nor was she then *Lady Amy Dudley* as legally she was no longer the wife of the son of an earl & duke.  I thought it was simpler to refer to her as just *Amy* throughout rather than explain the changes that occurred with her name & styles, but was told it was against WP *rules* (though I wasn't pointed to a link for it).  Noblewomen are usually called by their 1st names round here as far as I can see, even when they have surnames & are not *of* something!

"DECT isn't really a new technology. It's a newer standard, but TDM/TDMA/FDMA digital telephones have been used for a lot longer than the life of DECT. DECT is itself a successor to CT2, Japan's PHS is very similar, and, of course, GSM, D-AMPS, and others have been extensively used across the world for a decade and a half. To suggest there are special health issues with DECT would most definitely be placing undue weight on the subject. DECT is considerably lower power than the analog systems it replaces, both during transmissions, and inherently because even when in use the TD nature of the system means the system isn't transmitting continuously.

As I believe I've said before, there is nothing wrong with there being a properly researched article about the health effects of low-power radio technology, and there being a link in the See also: section of this article to it. That article, of course, should look nothing like the section I yanked. There is nothing about DECT however that merits a special section on DECT's dangers, especially when - new technology or otherwise - there is no serious level of concern being expressed by anyone authoritative on this issue.",0

Words of Encouragement to user """"""""Damemk"""""""" in the cases of dispute with the users engaged in Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda
Damemk, You have come to the same conclusions about Bulgarian 19th Century Nationalistic Propaganda on English Wikipedia.
User:Laveol is one of the most prominent editors on Wikipedia contributing false information in the articles about Republic of Macedonia, Macedonian Nation|History|Language|Culture|Sports and what else not.
He is spending a lot of time working on his cause, pushing Bulgarian Nature in the articles of the domain of Republic of Macedonia.
How far has he gone in pushing this propaganda you can see at Wikipedia:WikiProject_ROMacedonia where he has listed himself as a member.
So just my few words of concern for the Macedonian Articles in English Wikipedia, and the great damage done by User:Laveol and other users with the Bulgarian and Anti-Macedonian Propaganda.
Hopefully with the internet access becoming more affordable to the people in Republic of Macedonia the things will go in right direction: Removing the Bulgarian Propaganda from Macedonian articles, cleaning them of false fabricated information, and giving the facts to the world, and the views of the Macedonian Science and sources.
I don't have much time now, but hopefully will be able to find some more in the coming period. I am open to any collaboration|effort for the above goals.

I am expecting that this user """"""""Laveol"""""""" will continue with the Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda and polluting the domains in the domain of Republic of Macedonia, simply because he is able to, and can find a ways to continue to work on his agenda.
Ours is to try to remove these false claims and contribute the Facts about the Macedonia, Macedonian Nation|History|Lanugage|Culture|Sports.

Damemk, I hope you write something here, at least to show that User_talk:Damemk and User_talk:Ejanev is not the same user.    

Some insight into my user name Ejanev
The only user I am using to contribute to Wikipedia is """"""""Ejanev"""""""". It is composed of the first letter of my name """"""""Emil"""""""" and my last name """"""""Janev"""""""".
User """"""""Damemk"""""""" is a separate user. Probably that user name is comming from """"""""Dame"""""""" - a Macedonian First name, and """"""""mk"""""""" or the code of """"""""Republic of Macedonia"""""""".
It does happen that I am from Canada. I was born in Republic of Macedonia and have lived there until I moved to USA first and Canada before more than 3 years.

And yes, having all the false information from the Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda ( originating from the 19th century ) and having it into 21st century to be used to negate the Macedonian Nation and all it's attributes by users as """"""""Laveol"""""""", is the reason of some of my editing actions in Wikipedia.
I am not the only user/editor from Republic of Macedonia or with Macedonian origin that has the same views for this Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda, that already is infiltrated in the Macedonian articles.
You can watch the contributions of Special:Contributions/Laveol and see that more than 50% of his actions are engagement in negating the Macedonian Nation and its attributes.

 POV concerns 

Im surprised this article isn't being called anti-semetic, because it's has a *few* traces of Islamic perspectives in it. You know, as opposed to being a piece of Zionist propaganda being passed off as fair and balanced.

This entire article is full of baseless jewish propaganda. It is well documented the Banu Qurayza were executed for treason. That is what merited them the death penalty, that they commited treason. The Quarash and other tribes the Muslims fought against were outright enemies who were persecuting them from the start. But the Qurayza signed a peace treaty, then broke it by aiding the enemy. This article contains soo much jewish propaganda that you'd think they were executed for no reason (which no doubt is their aim). Here is a great example. Look at this citation

""""""""According to Stillman, Muhammad chose Sa'd ibn Mua'dh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself after the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir: """"""""Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery."""""""" Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba's gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender.""""""""

This author is Norman A Stillman, a Zionist Jew who is very biased. Why is he being used as a quote in an Islamic article? And further more, why is his baseless conjecture allowed to be used, as if it's a fact?

There are articles for """"""""Criticisms of Islam"""""""" where the Jews and others can write whatever they want. But they should have no hand in editing Islamic articles. Because I looked up the Jewish articles and I noticed they dont allow dissent there. You cant put a Muslim perspective on evil acts commited by Jews, without it disappearing instantly. So the same standard MUST be applied to Islamic articles. Islamic articles must be written from the Islamic point of view, and the jews can write their responses in appropriate """"""""criticisms of Islam"""""""" articles. If not, I will personally edit the Jewish articles and fill them with my conjectures about their history. And I will find a non-Jewish admin to arbitrate over the Islamic articles.

Good day.

  

Please read this talk page, specifically all of the places where """"""""treason"""""""" or """"""""traitor"""""""" is mentioned, and if you still believe that we need to mention treason, provide some reliable sources and we can discuss it.  It is easy for our article to be neutral and mention all POVs, but it does require that people like yourself participate.  We work from academic sources, not personal conjecture.   

Changes by Devotus and issues with them

Dear Devotus, 
I have still issues with your changes:
Bat Yeor and Ramadan - while I appreciate that you don't try you shift the balance - removing a book from """"""""each side"""""""" - I do not agree with your removal. Bat Yeor is an academic scholar and though her books are controversial, she is not beyond the pale - currently she doesn't serve as a reference in the article but if she did, the controversy would be noted. As for Ramadan I have issues with him as well but if we remove him from the literature section, we would have to remove him from the article too, in which he serves as a reference. This is due to the insistence of User:Bless sins. He will certainly not like such a removal. We cannot remove him from the literature section while retaining him in the article.
While your first version was needlessly verbose (""""""""it is to be noted that""""""""), the new one endorses that view by Paret/Watt. The article now says that the BQ were not killed for religious reasons - that is not a fact, since there is a good case that the whole conflict was caused by religious differences.
Also we do not want to repeat things that have already been said in the coverage of the """"""""siege and demise"""""""", e.g. the claim about attacking M. in the rear.
Also, please abide by the one resolved conflict. We fought hard and long about words like """"""""massacre"""""""" and """"""""execution"""""""" and neither should appear unless unavoidable.

 Mediation 

Hello, I am Atyndall and I have volunteered to take on your mediation case, during this discussion I will remain neutral with both sides of this argument and will endeavor to solve your dispute. After having a look at the discussion above, this is what I have found:
QuizzicalBee has been adding the sentence """"""""According to Chesler, the the U.S. embassy repeatedly refused to help her leave the country as they no longer recognized her as a U.S. citizen."""""""", Hurmata has been reverting this back to """"""""She reports that the U.S. embassy repeatedly refused to help her leave the country. Hurmata objects to QuizzicalBee's sentence as he/she thinks that the source is incorrect as the guards would have allowed Chesler into the embassy and first hand accounts from Chesler herself does not qualify as a reliable source. QB objects, saying that maybe in the 1960s US citizenship could have been revoked by the US/Afgan government at that time and perhaps in the past the guards may have denied entry and that her claim should have been presumed true until proven false. Hurmata countered that the citation threat QB was referring to is not the one that was cited. QB states that there is no evidence disproving her claims, so they are valid.

"Well, Arthur, I have printed the paper, and the condition is in fact what Ultra.Power says it is, not your correction. It seems that the paper is not incorrect, but rather correct and pointless.

You have already identified the worst problem: The third condition requires incontinuity of f at all integer values. However, this problem disappears if we consider only the special case a=e. So let's do that.

We want a function f satisfying f(1)=e and f(n+1)=exp(f(n)), defined as widely as possible. We observe that n=0 and n=1 present no problems: f(0)=1 and f(-1)=0.

To extend f to all positive real numbers, it is clearly sufficient to define f on an interval of length 1, such as [0,1).

And we want f to be continuously differentiable. (The paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable on (0,1), or equivalently on (-1,0). This is obviously whacky, but we needn't worry about this because a=e.)

Next, for no obvious (or explained) reason we require that f ' is monotone on the interval [0,1]. From the functional equation f(x) = ln f(x+1) we get f '(x) = f '(x+1)/f(x+1). Hence f '(-1)=f '(0)/f(0)=f '(0), so f ' must be constant on [0,1]! 

Not too surprisingly, the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way: f(x) = exp[x](exp(x-[x])).

Thus what I learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative between -1 and 0.",0

What i am trying to say is that although Bashar assad had good economic and international policies for Syria, you should not fear a non-baathist potentially being elected.  Syria's economic and international policies won't change (iran would still be a major factor in Syrian life considering the buisness deals stakes and cultural exchanges) , the only this that would change are social freedoms, and for the better. Also every country had a revolution and they are still alive today. The Muslim brotherhood in Syria is weak, even weaker than the islamist prescence in Libya. The rebels in Libya had 80-90% support, as we see now, and yet could hardly take control without NATO. What chance does the Syrian Muslim brotherhood have? None. If anything, nonviolent protests weaken the resolve of the Muslim brotherhood, making them less of an influence in the everyday life of Syrians. As you know I am pro Syria and Armenia, just not pro Assad.

 Lead 

What's there now is not a summary... summaries are supposed to be substantially shorter than the text they summarize, which the case at Salvatore Giunta is not. It simply copies whole sentances from the body text. As an editor, we have to assess the article as it currently stands, and not any hypothetical future stance.

"""""{{Unblock|I'll make a renewed effort not to give personal attacks. But of course I do have some questions about this unwarranted blockage, as you might well imagine:

1. Why is it that IP editors tend to get the raw ends of the deal: that you """"""""admins"""""""" tend to lean towards the side of someone who's editing with an account over someone who's editing without one, especially in the area of what you label as """"""""personal attacks"""""""" or """"""""harassment"""""""" when given by the IP-editor but not so much when the named editor does the same thing?

2. For exampleand this is... yep, maybe you guessed it... question 2: Why is it supposedly """"""""okay"""""""" (according to you) for someone with a name... like, say... escape orbit... to dish out a personal attack, but not for me to give him one back because I'm just a lowly IP-editor? Specifically, why is it supposedly """"""""okay"""""""" for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of """"""""ebaY"""""""" logo to go next to the current one, """"""""ebay,"""""""" in the lead, is """"""""because I wanted it in there,"""""""" even though that is a total lie; but it's supposedly """"""""not okay"""""""" for me to call that kind of slander stupid?

3. Here's another one: Why is it supposedly """"""""okay"""""""" for him and """"""""smiley girl"""""""" there to falsely accuse my edits of being """"""""vandalism"""""""" just because they differed from what these guys preferred, but then when I say their reversions are vandalism, I get in trouble for it as if it were a """"""""personal attack"""""""" just because I'm an IP-only editor?

4. Ready for one more? Then why is it fine for any of you named editors to give one of us IP-editors a warning template, but when I, as an IPer do the same thing to a named editor like I did to partially smiley girl, I get dinged with """"""""Oh, you can't do that 'cause that's a 'personal attack',"""""""" or """"""""Oh, that's bad because that's 'harassment' """"""""?

5. Oh yeah, here's one more! Remember the rule about edit-warring (just in general, meaning that it doesn't even have to be breaking 3RR) that says that """""""" 'but I was right, so I was not edit-warring' is no defense""""""""? Well then doesn't that apply to meeting some so-called """"""""consensus"""""""" too (since some things aren't cases of concrete correctness but are just based more on whether they match what that so-called """"""""consensus"""""""" wanted the thing to say)? Well then why is it that just because your named friend smiley there does some edit-warring against me to put the thing back to what your exclusive (partial) """"""""consensus"""""""" wants it to say, AND since my editing had already been established as NOT vandalism even though it disagrees, you ignore that above-mentioned edit-warring rule and give her/him a pass anyway, but when I, an IP-only editor who's against your exclusive """"""""consensus,"""""""" do the same thing, it's """"""""edit-warring"""""""" even though it was the same thing as what smiley's doing (remember the """"""""being-right/matching-consensus-is-no-defense"""""""" rule)?

 Bloc voting 

Countries with large populations of non-nationals may have their televote influenced considerably. This has been cited as the reason for apparent bloc voting in the Balkan countries of the former Yugoslavia.[91] 

This is full-blown crazy. What does """"""""non-nationals"""""""" mean? These countries have similar cultures and speak the same languages. The stars in Croatia are popular in Serbia and vice versa. People are nationals of their countries in the largest proportion in each of those countries (there are some refugees in each of those countries, but that doesn't really explain why Croatia would always give the highest no. .of pts to Serbia, or Macedonia to Serbia, where there was no conflict to speak of). For example, I'm a Bosnian Serb and me voting for a Croatian or a Serbian song is not unusual. But I'm not a Bosnian non-national. I have the passport of BiH, and my family has never lived in Serbia in history. It's really about mutual intelligibility  which is why Scandinavian bloc votes for each other all the time. It's the language and sensibility.""""",0

There is no WP:RS to affirm the veracity of DI's doubtful claim either.  That is, you have no WP:RS either way.  Therefore it is not a verifiable fact that Picard (or any of the other 103 original signers) consented to or agreed with the DI's published interpretation or political position vis-a-vis PBS or any other subsequent political purpose regarding what should or shouldn't be taught in school.

All you have on verifiable record is that the 103 original signers called for skeptical examination of the evidence for scientific theories.  DI's unverifiable claim which fraudulently spins that into consensual agreement or support for their interpretation or political agenda is not a fact under the rules of Wikipedia.  

All the rest of DI's propaganda is utter hogwash fraudulently perpetrated by the DI without the verifiably demonstrated consent of the original 103 individuals.

In view of the WP:BLP """"""""Do No Harm"""""""" clause, the unverified claim of the DI must not be promoted to fact and any content to that effect must be immediately expunged, per the WP:BLP:

"It is common knowledge that Karaims (but not Karaite Jews) boast descent from Khazars, but what they do not realize is that we believe the Он-окъ (On-oq) whence came (mixing with Carian mercenaries from Caphtor and Kolhkis) our Khazar ancestors were in fact the remnant of the lost Ten-Tribes of Israel who formed our priesthood. It is precisely for this reason that Karaite Jewish scholars like Jacob Ben Reuben of Byzanteum and Yefet ben Ali or Jeshua ben Judah call us bastards in their writings.

I thought that his conduct was insult-worthy at the time, as would any sane individual who was not familiar with Wikipedia's """"""""no-insult"""""""" rule, however I have since realized that what I did was wrong because this site does not allow for harsh words: which is why I will not use them again even if they are used against me, which they were during this ordeal.
